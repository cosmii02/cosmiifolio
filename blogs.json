Yes? (Laughter.) Okay. There we\u00a0go.</p>\n<p><em>(The portraits are unveiled.) </em>(Applause.)</p>\n<p>Thank you so much. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you! Thank you so\u00a0much.</p>\n<p>Please, everybody have a seat. Have a seat. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Sit down, everybody. Thank you very\u00a0much.</p>\n<p>It is great to be back. President and Dr. Biden, Vice President Harris and Second Gentleman Emhoff, thank you so much for your hospitality. Thanks for letting us invite a few friends to the White House. We will try not to tear up the\u00a0place.</p>\n<p>Someone\u200a\u2014\u200asomeone once said that if you\u2019re looking for a friend in Washington, get a dog. Our family was lucky enough to have two wonderful dogs. But I was even luckier to have a chance to spend eight years working day and night with a man who became a true partner and a true\u00a0friend.</p>\n<p>Joe, it is now America\u2019s good fortune to have you as President. You have guided us through some perilous times. You\u2019ve built on and gone beyond the work we all did together to expand healthcare, to fight climate change, to advance social justice, and to promote economic fairness.</p>\n<p>Thanks to your decency and thanks to your strength\u200a\u2014\u200amaybe most of all thanks to your faith in our democracy and the American people\u200a\u2014\u200athe country is better off than when you took office, and we should all be deeply grateful for that. So, thank you so\u00a0much.</p>\n<p>To all the former Obama-Biden staffers who are here in person, some of you are watching at home, thank you for being a part of this. When people ask me what I miss most about the White House years, it is not Air Force One that I talk about. Although, I miss Air Force One. It is the chance that I had to stand shoulder to shoulder with all of you; to have a chance to witness so many talented, selfless, idealistic, good people working tirelessly every day to make the world\u00a0better.</p>\n<p>And for eight years, and even longer for some of you, I drew on your energy and your dedication and your goodness. You inspired me, and I never wanted to disappoint you. And I tried to reflect the same heart and character that you displayed every day. Even during the toughest times, it was all of you that kept me going. So, it\u2019s good to be back to have a chance to see all of you and to, once again, say thank\u00a0you.</p>\n<p>Now, as much as I miss our work together, what\u2019s been a special joy is to see what\u2019s happened since because so many of you are doing amazing things, whether it\u2019s in government, in the private sector, in academia, or non-profits.</p>\n<p>And I\u2019m especially glad to see so many of you serving President Biden as well as you served me\u200a\u2014\u200aalthough now some of you who, let\u2019s face it, you were kids back then, are now in charge and running the show\u2014 which is a little shocking\u200a\u2014\u200aand may also explain some of the grey hairs I\u2019m seeing on some of\u00a0you.</p>\n<p>But it validates what I had always hoped, which was that our time together would only be the beginning of incredibly impactful careers.</p>\n<p>And some of you who\u2019ve I\u2019ve had a chance to stay in touch with, I\u2019m thrilled to see that you\u2019ve started families of your own. I am a little disappointed that I haven\u2019t heard of anyone naming a kid \u201cBarack\u201d\u00a0yet.</p>\n<p>FIRST LADY OBAMA: Or Michelle.</p>\n<p>PRESIDENT OBAMA: Or Michelle. But there is still\u00a0time.</p>\n<p>Finally, I want to say a special thanks to the White House staff. We had a chance to see them all beforehand. You took incredible care of our family for eight years. And along the way, you became a part of it. And we have not ever forgotten the kindness that you showed\u00a0us.</p>\n<p>Now, when Michelle and I had our portraits unveiled at the National Portrait Gallery a few years back, I said that, as far as I could tell, no one in my family tree had ever sat for a portrait before. I certainly had not. And now, all of a sudden, we\u2019ve done it\u00a0twice.</p>\n<p>But these portraits today have a special significance, because, as Joe mentioned, they will hang in the White House alongside portraits of other Presidents and First Ladies dating back to George and Martha. So, it was important to find the right people to paint\u00a0them.</p>\n<p>I want to thank Sharon Sprung for capturing everything I love about Michelle\u200a\u2014\u200aher grace, her intelligence, and the fact that she\u2019s fine. I\u2019m just saying. She is. Her portrait is stunning.</p>\n<p>And I want to thank Robert McCurdy for taking on a much more difficult subject\u200a\u2014\u200aand doing a fantastic job with\u00a0mine.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*owEywm9J3y5lewfSVV20LQ.jpeg\"><figcaption>Portrait by Robert\u00a0McCurdy</figcaption></figure><p>Robert is known for his paintings of public figures\u200a\u2014\u200aToni Morrison, the Dalai Lama, Nelson Mandela, Muhammad Ali. But what I love about Robert\u2019s work is that he paints people exactly the way they are, for better or worse. He captures every wrinkle on your face, every crease in your\u00a0shirt.</p>\n<p>You\u2019ll note that he refused to hide any of my grey hairs. Refused my request to make my ears\u00a0smaller.</p>\n<p>He also talked me out of wearing a tan suit, by the way. (Laughter and applause.) So\u200a\u2014\u200a(laughs). (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>His work is so precise that, at first glance, it looks like a photograph. And Robert also paints his subjects looking straight ahead, so it feels like you\u2019re face-to-face, forming a connection.</p>\n<p>And that appealed to me, in part because Presidents so often get airbrushed. They even take on a mythical status, especially after you\u2019ve gone and people forget all the stuff they didn\u2019t like about\u00a0you.</p>\n<p>But what you realize when you\u2019re sitting behind that desk, and what I want people to remember about Michelle and me, is that Presidents and First Ladies are human beings like everyone else. We have our gifts. We have our flaws. You\u2019ve all experienced mine. We have good days and bad days. We feel the same joy and sadness, frustration and\u00a0hope.</p>\n<p>And while it takes a certain amount of self-confidence to be President, there are nights where we lie awake wondering if this or that decision was the right\u00a0one.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve always described the presidency as a relay race. You take the baton from someone, you run your leg as hard and as well as you can, and then you hand it off to someone else, knowing that your work will be incomplete. The portraits hanging in the White House chronicle the runners in that race\u200a\u2014\u200aeach of us tasked with trying to bring the country we love closer to its highest aspirations.</p>\n<p>And when future generations walk these halls and look up at these portraits, I hope they get a better, honest sense of who Michelle and I were. And I hope they leave with a deeper understanding that if we could make it here, maybe they can too; they can do remarkable things\u00a0too.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-UjprUaGxENdFPEWrpmFOQ.jpeg\"><figcaption>Photo by Pete\u00a0Souza</figcaption></figure><p>Now, it is my pleasure to introduce someone who needs no introduction.

But you all knew\u200a\u2014\u200aknow who you are, from the campaign, to the White House, to today. I would not be who I am without your passion and your faith, and all of the love that you poured into everything that we accomplished together. And it was amazing\u200a\u2014\u200ahistoric.</p>\n<p>What did Sam Kass used to\u00a0say?</p>\n<p>AUDIENCE MEMBER: Unprecedented!</p>\n<p>FIRST LADY OBAMA: Unprecedented.</p>\n<p>You all mean the world to me. And I mean that from the bottom of my heart. So, thank you. Proud of you. Proud of the work that you\u2019ve done. Proud of what you\u2019re\u00a0doing.</p>\n<p>I also want to take the time to recognize the Residence staff. As Barack said, you guys made this a home. We snatched up a few of you all and took you with us. But for those of you who we couldn\u2019t bring, we miss you so much. We miss you so much. The best part about this house was you all. So, it\u2019s so good to see you. And you all look good\u200a\u2014\u200aso\u00a0good.</p>\n<p>I\u2019d also like to recognize Stewart McLaurin; of course, John Rogers. It\u2019s been amazing working you all over the\u00a0years.</p>\n<p>I have to recognize Bill Allman, who has been fabulous to work with over the\u00a0years.</p>\n<p>And of course, Thelma Golden and my dear friend Michael Smith for their\u200a\u2014\u200awe are where we are because of their comprehensive and rigorous work to identify these incredible artists.</p>\n<p>And that brings me to our artist. Of course, Robert McCurdy, who\u200a\u2014\u200ayou know, you did a good job. (Laughter.) You did a good\u00a0job.</p>\n<p>But I got to spend a lot of time Sharon Sprung. And Sharon now joins a small but mighty group of women who\u2019ve painted an official portrait here at the White House. (Applause.)</p>\n<p>And I\u2019m thrilled that this extraordinary work is going to be enshrined forever as part of our nation\u2019s\u00a0history.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*SP-H7vJ4j2uqoP0olzqlfQ.jpeg\"><figcaption>Portrait by Sharon\u00a0Sprung</figcaption></figure><p>But, Sharon, it was wonderful to work with you. You are a true spirit; that\u2019s one of the reasons why we connected. Your work is phenomenal, but it was your essence, your soul, the way you saw me, the way we interacted\u200a\u2014\u200aand it shows in this beautiful work.</p>\n<p>So, thank you for your brilliance, your artistry, and your patience\u2014 in this\u00a0process.</p>\n<p>I remember I went to see the work in Brooklyn. And poor Sharon, because no one is supposed to know who the artists are. So, her studio is her home. And so, she had this piece in her home. You couldn\u2019t have guests over. You were frightened that it would get out. You just wanted it out of your space. And every year, I thought about, she must be going\u00a0crazy.</p>\n<p>So, thank you. Thank you so much. Let\u2019s give them both a round of applause. (Applause.)</p>\n<p>Oh, believe it or not, it is still a bit odd for me to stand in this historic space, see this big, beautiful painting staring back at me. Growing up on Euclid Avenue, Mommy, I never could have imagined that any of this would be part of my\u00a0story.</p>\n<p>But even if it\u2019s all still a bit awkward for me, I do recognize why moments like these are important, why all of this is absolutely necessary. Traditions like this matter not just for those of us who hold these positions, but for everyone participating in and watching our democracy.</p>\n<p>You see, the people\u200a\u2014\u200athey make their voices heard with their vote. We hold an inauguration to ensure a peaceful transition of power. Those of us lucky enough to serve work, as Barack said, as hard as we can for as long as we can, as long as the people choose to keep us here. And once our time is up, we move\u00a0on.</p>\n<p>And all that remains in this hallowed place are our good efforts and these portraits\u200a\u2014\u200aportraits that connect our history to the present day, portraits that hang here as history continues to be\u00a0made.</p>\n<p>So, for me, this day is not just about what has happened. It\u2019s also about what could\u00a0happen.</p>\n<p>Because a girl like me, she was never supposed to be up there next to Jacqueline Kennedy and Dolley Madison. She was never supposed to live in this house, and she definitely wasn\u2019t supposed to serve as First\u00a0Lady.</p>\n<p>AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you, Michelle!</p>\n<p>FIRST LADY OBAMA: Love you\u00a0back.</p>\n<p>But I\u2019ve always wondered: Where does that \u201csupposed to\u201d come from? Who determines it?</p>\n<p>And too often in this country, people feel like they have to look a certain way or act a certain way to fit in, that they have to make a lot of money or come from a certain group or class or faith in order to\u00a0matter.</p>\n<p>But what we\u2019re looking at today\u200a\u2014\u200aa portrait of a biracial kid with an unusual name\u200a\u2014\u200aand the daughter of a water pump operator and a stay-at-home mom\u200a\u2014\u200awhat we are seeing is a reminder that there\u2019s a place for everyone in this\u00a0country.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*U5oN0-NkU4ppa-Jw4GmZ1Q.jpeg\"><figcaption>Photo by Pete\u00a0Souza</figcaption></figure><p>Because as Barack said, if the two of us can end up on the walls of the most famous address in the world, then, again, it is so important for every young kid who is doubting themselves to believe that they can,\u00a0too.</p>\n<p>That is what this country is about. It\u2019s not about blood or pedigree or wealth. It\u2019s a place where everyone should have a fair shot, whether you\u2019re a kid taking two buses and a train just to get to school; or a single mother who is working two jobs to put some food on the table; or an immigrant just arriving, getting your first apartment, forging a future for yourself in a place you dreamed\u00a0of.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s why, for me, this day isn\u2019t about me or Barack. It\u2019s not even about these beautiful paintings. It\u2019s about telling that fuller story\u200a\u2014\u200aa story that includes every single American in every single corner of this country so that our kids and grandkids can see something more for themselves.</p>\n<p>And as much as some folks might want us to believe that that story has lost some of its shine, that division and discrimination and everything else might have dimmed its light, I still know deep in my heart that what we share\u200a\u2014\u200aas my husband continues to say\u200a\u2014\u200ais so much bigger than what we don\u2019t. Our democracy is so much stronger than our differences.</p>\n<p>And this little girl from the South Side is blessed beyond measure to have felt the truth of that fuller story throughout her entire life, never more so than\u00a0today.</p>\n<p>So, thank you to President Biden, to Sharon, and to all of you today for playing a part in this day and all the days that led to\u00a0it.</p>\n<p>And now, it is my privilege to introduce someone who is stepping in shoes and doing it well, someone who has devoted so much of her life to education, working to broaden the idea of whose story\u00a0matters.</p>\n<p>Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome my friend, First Lady Dr. Jill\u00a0Biden.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ec3096d4f3fd\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n","content":"\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vE2MBg2Qtfs-GOTtZryd_A.jpeg\"><figcaption>Photo by Pete\u00a0Souza</figcaption></figure><p><strong><em>Remarks as delivered in The White House East Room with President Biden and First Lady Dr. Biden.

Yes? (Laughter.) Okay. There we\u00a0go.</p>\n<p><em>(The portraits are unveiled.) </em>(Applause.)</p>\n<p>Thank you so much. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you! Thank you so\u00a0much.</p>\n<p>Please, everybody have a seat. Have a seat. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Sit down, everybody. Thank you very\u00a0much.</p>\n<p>It is great to be back. President and Dr. Biden, Vice President Harris and Second Gentleman Emhoff, thank you so much for your hospitality. Thanks for letting us invite a few friends to the White House. We will try not to tear up the\u00a0place.</p>\n<p>Someone\u200a\u2014\u200asomeone once said that if you\u2019re looking for a friend in Washington, get a dog. Our family was lucky enough to have two wonderful dogs. But I was even luckier to have a chance to spend eight years working day and night with a man who became a true partner and a true\u00a0friend.</p>\n<p>Joe, it is now America\u2019s good fortune to have you as President. You have guided us through some perilous times. You\u2019ve built on and gone beyond the work we all did together to expand healthcare, to fight climate change, to advance social justice, and to promote economic fairness.</p>\n<p>Thanks to your decency and thanks to your strength\u200a\u2014\u200amaybe most of all thanks to your faith in our democracy and the American people\u200a\u2014\u200athe country is better off than when you took office, and we should all be deeply grateful for that. So, thank you so\u00a0much.</p>\n<p>To all the former Obama-Biden staffers who are here in person, some of you are watching at home, thank you for being a part of this. When people ask me what I miss most about the White House years, it is not Air Force One that I talk about. Although, I miss Air Force One. It is the chance that I had to stand shoulder to shoulder with all of you; to have a chance to witness so many talented, selfless, idealistic, good people working tirelessly every day to make the world\u00a0better.</p>\n<p>And for eight years, and even longer for some of you, I drew on your energy and your dedication and your goodness. You inspired me, and I never wanted to disappoint you. And I tried to reflect the same heart and character that you displayed every day. Even during the toughest times, it was all of you that kept me going. So, it\u2019s good to be back to have a chance to see all of you and to, once again, say thank\u00a0you.</p>\n<p>Now, as much as I miss our work together, what\u2019s been a special joy is to see what\u2019s happened since because so many of you are doing amazing things, whether it\u2019s in government, in the private sector, in academia, or non-profits.</p>\n<p>And I\u2019m especially glad to see so many of you serving President Biden as well as you served me\u200a\u2014\u200aalthough now some of you who, let\u2019s face it, you were kids back then, are now in charge and running the show\u2014 which is a little shocking\u200a\u2014\u200aand may also explain some of the grey hairs I\u2019m seeing on some of\u00a0you.</p>\n<p>But it validates what I had always hoped, which was that our time together would only be the beginning of incredibly impactful careers.</p>\n<p>And some of you who\u2019ve I\u2019ve had a chance to stay in touch with, I\u2019m thrilled to see that you\u2019ve started families of your own. I am a little disappointed that I haven\u2019t heard of anyone naming a kid \u201cBarack\u201d\u00a0yet.</p>\n<p>FIRST LADY OBAMA: Or Michelle.</p>\n<p>PRESIDENT OBAMA: Or Michelle. But there is still\u00a0time.</p>\n<p>Finally, I want to say a special thanks to the White House staff. We had a chance to see them all beforehand. You took incredible care of our family for eight years. And along the way, you became a part of it. And we have not ever forgotten the kindness that you showed\u00a0us.</p>\n<p>Now, when Michelle and I had our portraits unveiled at the National Portrait Gallery a few years back, I said that, as far as I could tell, no one in my family tree had ever sat for a portrait before. I certainly had not. And now, all of a sudden, we\u2019ve done it\u00a0twice.</p>\n<p>But these portraits today have a special significance, because, as Joe mentioned, they will hang in the White House alongside portraits of other Presidents and First Ladies dating back to George and Martha. So, it was important to find the right people to paint\u00a0them.</p>\n<p>I want to thank Sharon Sprung for capturing everything I love about Michelle\u200a\u2014\u200aher grace, her intelligence, and the fact that she\u2019s fine. I\u2019m just saying. She is. Her portrait is stunning.</p>\n<p>And I want to thank Robert McCurdy for taking on a much more difficult subject\u200a\u2014\u200aand doing a fantastic job with\u00a0mine.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*owEywm9J3y5lewfSVV20LQ.jpeg\"><figcaption>Portrait by Robert\u00a0McCurdy</figcaption></figure><p>Robert is known for his paintings of public figures\u200a\u2014\u200aToni Morrison, the Dalai Lama, Nelson Mandela, Muhammad Ali. But what I love about Robert\u2019s work is that he paints people exactly the way they are, for better or worse. He captures every wrinkle on your face, every crease in your\u00a0shirt.</p>\n<p>You\u2019ll note that he refused to hide any of my grey hairs. Refused my request to make my ears\u00a0smaller.</p>\n<p>He also talked me out of wearing a tan suit, by the way. (Laughter and applause.) So\u200a\u2014\u200a(laughs). (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>His work is so precise that, at first glance, it looks like a photograph. And Robert also paints his subjects looking straight ahead, so it feels like you\u2019re face-to-face, forming a connection.</p>\n<p>And that appealed to me, in part because Presidents so often get airbrushed. They even take on a mythical status, especially after you\u2019ve gone and people forget all the stuff they didn\u2019t like about\u00a0you.</p>\n<p>But what you realize when you\u2019re sitting behind that desk, and what I want people to remember about Michelle and me, is that Presidents and First Ladies are human beings like everyone else. We have our gifts. We have our flaws. You\u2019ve all experienced mine. We have good days and bad days. We feel the same joy and sadness, frustration and\u00a0hope.</p>\n<p>And while it takes a certain amount of self-confidence to be President, there are nights where we lie awake wondering if this or that decision was the right\u00a0one.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve always described the presidency as a relay race. You take the baton from someone, you run your leg as hard and as well as you can, and then you hand it off to someone else, knowing that your work will be incomplete. The portraits hanging in the White House chronicle the runners in that race\u200a\u2014\u200aeach of us tasked with trying to bring the country we love closer to its highest aspirations.</p>\n<p>And when future generations walk these halls and look up at these portraits, I hope they get a better, honest sense of who Michelle and I were. And I hope they leave with a deeper understanding that if we could make it here, maybe they can too; they can do remarkable things\u00a0too.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-UjprUaGxENdFPEWrpmFOQ.jpeg\"><figcaption>Photo by Pete\u00a0Souza</figcaption></figure><p>Now, it is my pleasure to introduce someone who needs no introduction. Michelle was the best thing about living in the White House. And let me tell you, the pastry chefs here deliver delicious pies on request\u200a\u2014\u200aso that is saying something.</p>\n<p>I could not ask for a better life partner, and in my humble opinion, America could not have asked for a better First\u00a0Lady.</p>\n<p>Please give it up for Michelle\u00a0Obama.</p>\n<h3>Remarks by Mrs.\u00a0Obama:</h3>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pFJZiUgOBrjnBz-V9kxhsA.jpeg\"><figcaption>Photo by Pete\u00a0Souza</figcaption></figure><p>FIRST LADY OBAMA: Thank you.

Thank you for inviting us back. This means so much to\u00a0us.</p>\n<p>We were saying at lunch that the girls have lived in this house longer than they\u2019ve lived anywhere. And so this, as odd of a home as this can be, as wonderful it can\u200a\u2014\u200aas it can be\u200a\u2014\u200ait is a\u200a\u2014\u200ait is a special place because we raised our girls here. And it means so much to come back to friends and to be able to spend time talking about our\u00a0girls.</p>\n<p>And so, I am grateful to both of you for the work that you\u2019re doing; the love that you\u2019re showing us, our staff; and the work that you\u2019re doing for this country. Thank you so\u00a0much.</p>\n<p>And, of course, to Vice President Harris and\u200a\u2014\u200aI love to say this\u200a\u2014\u200aSecond Gentleman Emhoff. Let\u2019s say it again: Second Gentleman. You\u2019re doing a great job. Thank you for joining us\u00a0today.</p>\n<p>And I can\u2019t go any further without, of course, acknowledging all of the amazing staff\u200a\u2014\u200afriends. It\u2019s\u200a\u2014\u200ayou\u2019re more than staff. You\u2019re friends. You\u2019re family to us, particularly the people who have been a part of my team over the\u00a0years.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t have time to name everyone, thank goodness. But you all knew\u200a\u2014\u200aknow who you are, from the campaign, to the White House, to today. I would not be who I am without your passion and your faith, and all of the love that you poured into everything that we accomplished together.

Our democracy is so much stronger than our differences.</p>\n<p>And this little girl from the South Side is blessed beyond measure to have felt the truth of that fuller story throughout her entire life, never more so than\u00a0today.</p>\n<p>So, thank you to President Biden, to Sharon, and to all of you today for playing a part in this day and all the days that led to\u00a0it.</p>\n<p>And now, it is my privilege to introduce someone who is stepping in shoes and doing it well, someone who has devoted so much of her life to education, working to broaden the idea of whose story\u00a0matters.</p>\n<p>Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome my friend, First Lady Dr. Jill\u00a0Biden.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ec3096d4f3fd\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n","enclosure":{},"categories":[]},{"title":"My 2022 Summer Lists","pubDate":"2022-07-26 19:02:21","link":"https://barackobama.medium.com/my-2022-summer-lists-264bc5ab1b0a?source=rss-9e422a605dc5------2","guid":"https://medium.com/p/264bc5ab1b0a","author":"Barack Obama","thumbnail":"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*36vHbH_u9n7r6MZ7ALM0Cw.png","description":"\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*36vHbH_u9n7r6MZ7ALM0Cw.png\"></figure><h3>Summer Reading\u00a0List</h3>\n<p>I\u2019ve read a couple of great books this year and wanted to share some of my favorites so far.

Amid congressional gridlock and decades of failure to address our broken immigration system, my administration took action to protect hundreds of thousands of young people who were American in every way but\u00a0one.</p>\n<p>These Dreamers came to this country very young, sometimes as infants, and did everything right. They studied hard, worked hard, and proved to their parents that the risk of coming to America had paid off. Many did not know they were undocumented until they applied to college or tried to enlist in the military. And not only did a piece of paper suddenly stand in the way of their aspirations, it added a threat of deportation to a country they might not know with a language they might not\u00a0speak.</p>\n<p>But rather than accepting defeat and living in fear, these Dreamers did the opposite: They publicly proclaimed their immigration status. They showed how much the American Dream meant to them, sharing their stories of hope and heartbreak. And they called on their elected officials to do something to fix the system. That\u2019s who I was thinking about when our administration made it possible for them to apply for work authorization and protection from deportation through Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). Instead of living in fear, DACA made it possible for these promising young Americans to continue to thrive in the only country they had ever called home. It lifted the shadow of deportation from people of extraordinary promise. And the results\u200a\u2014\u200afor them and for us all\u200a\u2014\u200acannot be\u00a0denied.</p>\n<p>The more than 800,000 people who have received DACA protection are now teachers, service members, business owners, doctors, and parents. They are our friends and neighbors. With the protection of DACA, they helped to close the gap in high school graduation rates between citizens and noncitizens by 40 percent, as one study found. More than 200,000 of them have served on the frontlines of our nation\u2019s COVID-19 response, working on behalf of their fellow Americans at great risk to themselves. And hundreds more have defended our country in the military, making all of us safer. A few weeks ago, I met with several DACA recipients who are excelling in medicine, organizing, and more. To me, they\u2019re exceptional in part because I know they\u2019re not exceptions\u200a\u2014\u200athere are hundreds of thousands of stories like theirs. We are a better nation\u200a\u2014\u200aa stronger nation\u200a\u2014\u200abecause of DACA recipients.</p>\n<p>It is not lost on them or me that the DACA program was, and is, temporary. It remains vulnerable to politicians who choose to ignore DACA\u2019s remarkable benefits to our country. These Dreamers lived through the cruelty of the previous administration\u2019s attacks and legal challenges to the program, their families, and their communities. And Dreamers graduating high school or entering the workforce today face an even steeper climb than they did a decade ago. Only a quarter of the undocumented students graduating high school this year are eligible for DACA under existing rules. Some states restrict in-state tuition from undocumented students, even when they meet all residency requirements. And some professions remain out of reach because of a patchwork of unreasonable state-level licensing requirements.</p>\n<p>For all they have done for our nation, and all they will continue to do, DACA recipients and their families deserve better. Today, I\u2019m renewing my call for Congress to redouble its efforts to build a smart and compassionate immigration system that offers Dreamers a path to citizenship. Let\u2019s honor these Dreamers and everything they\u2019ve done to strengthen our country. Let\u2019s treat them like the Americans that they are.

Amid congressional gridlock and decades of failure to address our broken immigration system, my administration took action to protect hundreds of thousands of young people who were American in every way but\u00a0one.</p>\n<p>These Dreamers came to this country very young, sometimes as infants, and did everything right. They studied hard, worked hard, and proved to their parents that the risk of coming to America had paid off. Many did not know they were undocumented until they applied to college or tried to enlist in the military. And not only did a piece of paper suddenly stand in the way of their aspirations, it added a threat of deportation to a country they might not know with a language they might not\u00a0speak.</p>\n<p>But rather than accepting defeat and living in fear, these Dreamers did the opposite: They publicly proclaimed their immigration status. They showed how much the American Dream meant to them, sharing their stories of hope and heartbreak. And they called on their elected officials to do something to fix the system. That\u2019s who I was thinking about when our administration made it possible for them to apply for work authorization and protection from deportation through Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). Instead of living in fear, DACA made it possible for these promising young Americans to continue to thrive in the only country they had ever called home. It lifted the shadow of deportation from people of extraordinary promise. And the results\u200a\u2014\u200afor them and for us all\u200a\u2014\u200acannot be\u00a0denied.</p>\n<p>The more than 800,000 people who have received DACA protection are now teachers, service members, business owners, doctors, and parents. They are our friends and neighbors. With the protection of DACA, they helped to close the gap in high school graduation rates between citizens and noncitizens by 40 percent, as one study found. More than 200,000 of them have served on the frontlines of our nation\u2019s COVID-19 response, working on behalf of their fellow Americans at great risk to themselves. And hundreds more have defended our country in the military, making all of us safer. A few weeks ago, I met with several DACA recipients who are excelling in medicine, organizing, and more. To me, they\u2019re exceptional in part because I know they\u2019re not exceptions\u200a\u2014\u200athere are hundreds of thousands of stories like theirs. We are a better nation\u200a\u2014\u200aa stronger nation\u200a\u2014\u200abecause of DACA recipients.</p>\n<p>It is not lost on them or me that the DACA program was, and is, temporary. It remains vulnerable to politicians who choose to ignore DACA\u2019s remarkable benefits to our country. These Dreamers lived through the cruelty of the previous administration\u2019s attacks and legal challenges to the program, their families, and their communities. And Dreamers graduating high school or entering the workforce today face an even steeper climb than they did a decade ago. Only a quarter of the undocumented students graduating high school this year are eligible for DACA under existing rules. Some states restrict in-state tuition from undocumented students, even when they meet all residency requirements. And some professions remain out of reach because of a patchwork of unreasonable state-level licensing requirements.</p>\n<p>For all they have done for our nation, and all they will continue to do, DACA recipients and their families deserve better. Today, I\u2019m renewing my call for Congress to redouble its efforts to build a smart and compassionate immigration system that offers Dreamers a path to citizenship. Let\u2019s honor these Dreamers and everything they\u2019ve done to strengthen our country. Let\u2019s treat them like the Americans that they are. And let\u2019s do everything we can to help build a commonsense immigration system that honors our heritage as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. It\u2019s on all of us to finish this\u00a0work.</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/a0eef37e487abf1a1839b6b09d09fcb0/href\">https://medium.com/media/a0eef37e487abf1a1839b6b09d09fcb0/href</a><h3>Mi Declaraci\u00f3n Sobre el D\u00e9cimo Aniversario de\u00a0DACA</h3>\n<p>Hace diez a\u00f1os, nuestra naci\u00f3n fortaleci\u00f3 su compromiso con el principio de que todo estadounidense merece la oportunidad de construir una vida mejor aqu\u00ed.

Thank you. Well, thank you, Sahra-Josephine, for that introduction, and the extraordinary work that you are doing. And I want to thank my old friend, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, for hosting me and our extraordinary Obama Foundation leaders here today. It is wonderful to see all of you and I\u2019m confident that there have been extraordinary discussions that have been taking place since this conference began.<br><br>As we meet, Ukraine obviously weighs heavily on our hearts and minds. We\u2019ve all witnessed the terrible suffering in a war that recalls Europe\u2019s darkest history. But we have also witnessed the Ukrainian peoples\u2019 heroic resistance to Russian aggression. They\u2019ve united to defend not just their sovereignty, but their democratic identity, and their actions have rallied much of the world behind the values of self-determination and human dignity. It\u2019s inspiring.<br><br>Because of the courage and because of this solidarity on display, Vladimir Putin is failing to achieve his aims inside of Ukraine and beyond. NATO has stepped up and has grown stronger. Finland and Sweden are seeking swift accession. Countries have welcomed displaced Ukrainians with open arms. Meanwhile, Russia is cut off from resources and revenue, and many of its best and brightest have left, a blow to its present, but also to its future.<br><br>So we should take heart from Ukrainian resolve and from renewed transatlantic solidarity, and I know that\u2019s been discussed at this conference. These are signs of hope amidst despair. But make no mistake: this war is far from over. The costs will continue to mount. The course of events, as Anders and I discussed before we came out, are hard to predict. And our support for Ukraine must remain strong, steadfast and sustained until this conflict reaches a resolution.<br><br>Now, while Ukraine properly commands our immediate attention, it\u2019s also important to recognize that Putin\u2019s lawlessness is not happening in isolation. As I\u2019m sure previous speakers have noted, on every continent, we are seeing democratic backsliding. On every continent, emboldened autocrats are ramping up oppression, they\u2019re targeting minority groups, they\u2019re often flouting international law. Just as disturbing, within democracies, populist appeals grounded in fear and bigotry and resentment, have elevated leaders who, once they\u2019re in office, have sought to systematically undermine democratic institutions and entrench themselves in power. In my own country, the forces that unleashed mob violence on our Capitol are still churning out misinformation and conspiracy theories.<br><br>For those of us who fervently believe in the ideals of democracy, the question is: How do we\u00a0respond?</p>\n<p>If nothing else, recent events should shake us out of complacency. There was a trend after the fall of the Berlin Wall, a sense that history was inevitably going to usher in a democratic world. Well, we\u2019ve been reminded that democratic practice, democracy is neither inevitable nor self-executing. Most of recorded history is a chronicle of violence, and ignorance, and conflict; of strong nations subjugating weak nations, of groups using tribe, or race, or gender, or religion to justify dominion over others, to grant land and territory and resources. Sometimes they do it just because they can. Democracy, by contrast, has for most of human history been the anomaly. And in a relatively small period of time, in fits and starts. Through revolution, struggle, and sacrifice, democracy took hold in a few places, and then began in fits and starts, to spread, elsewhere in the globe. That expansion has helped contain some of humanity\u2019s baser impulses. But those instincts, those impulses were never eliminated, nor were the old structures of privilege and exploitation that they produced.<br><br>So the point is, if we want democracy to flourish, we will have to fight for it, we will have to nurture it, we will have to demonstrate its value, again and again, in improving the lives of ordinary people. And we will also have to be willing to look squarely at the shortcomings of our own democracies, not the ideal, but the reality of our own democracies. Only then will we be able to tell a better story of what democracy can be, and must be, in this rapidly changing world.<br><br>Now, for some of us, certainly those attending this conference, particularly those of you with gray hair like me, the virtues of democracy may seem obvious. For those generations scarred by successive World Wars, it was clear where dictatorship and master race theories and religious intolerance, and rampant nationalism could lead, because we\u2019d seen it here in Europe and elsewhere in the world, with bombed out cities and broken lives, as many as sixty million dead worldwide during World War II, Auschwitz, Stalin\u2019s gulags. For the Allies who emerged victorious, the goal was to prevent a repeat of such tragic history. So they built institutions to check unbridled power and to protect civil society and to foster pluralism. And they realized, well, if we\u2019re going to fight this battle, maybe we have to fix some of the things in our own democracies and make them more representative, make our hypocrisy, the gap between our words and our deeds, less obvious. Internationally they erected a multilateral system to reinforce international norms, recognize universal rights, and encourage the peaceful resolution of disputes.<br><br>As imperfect as these institutions were, most people during this period understood, to paraphrase Churchill, that democracy beat the alternatives. Two cheers for democracy. The notion was that democracy might not prevent every foolish war, but it made them less likely. Democracy might not end poverty and racism, but it could make things better. And, in fact, progress was real. But it was also incomplete.<br><br>That was a long time ago. I\u2019m now 60, and it happened before I was around. Most of the people alive on the earth today don\u2019t have that as a reference point.<br><br>Today, abstract appeals about democracy won\u2019t persuade the jobless youth on the outskirts of Paris, may not persuade families in Northern England struggling to pay the bills, or the displaced workers in the former factory towns of the American Midwest. And they barely register with the hundreds of millions of people trapped in poverty around the world.<br><br>A few weeks ago, I met with some young leaders who\u2019d just completed one of our Obama Foundation programs. We were in New York City. One of the participants was a remarkable young African who built an organization that expands educational opportunities for underserved youth, and he asked me a question. He said, \u201cPresident Obama, how do I answer my peers who argue that democracy in our country has failed to deliver? Everywhere, we see corruption, poverty, a lack of progress, despite election after election. When my peers look at China,\u201d he said, \u201cthey see a model of orderly advancement and material improvement in peoples\u2019 lives. So even if it means restrictions on some freedoms, isn\u2019t that worth the trade-offs?\u201d<br><br>Instinctively, I pointed out that the same system in China that his friends were praising now had let millions die of starvation and produced the chaos of the Cultural Revolution. I told the young man that he was too young to remember what life was like in his own country, before democracy came, that there had been a brutal civil war that also resulted in the death of millions, chronic corruption and then strife under subsequent military regimes. So I told him, \u201cYou need to broaden your lens,\u201d and he listened politely. What was he going to do? Maybe he was even moved by my arguments, but you could tell he didn\u2019t think his peers would be, at least not until those arguments were accompanied by measurable changes in their lives, where they live, in the here and now, not by reference to what happened 30 or 40 or 50 years ago.<br><br>I\u2019m convinced some version of this conversation is taking place right now in every country and on every continent. I\u2019m also convinced that, for us to win that contest of ideas between those of us who believe in democracy and those who are convinced that older ways of doing business are better, in that contest of ideas, it won\u2019t be enough to just say what we\u2019re against. We have to describe clearly what we are for. It won\u2019t be enough to reaffirm a creaky status quo, to just put a new coat of paint on the existing order, because the fact is, that order has been shaken at its foundations by globalization, financial crisis and social media, by rising inequality and mass migration, and climate change and a multi-polar world. If we are going to fortify democracy, if democracy is going to thrive and not just survive in a few pockets on the map, we are going to have to rebuild our democracies and our institutions, so they work better for more people for this new age.<br><br>Now, I\u2019m not here to offer a ten-point plan. I\u2019m no longer running for office. (Laughter.) Also, I don\u2019t have all the answers. Mainly I\u2019m not here to offer a ten-point place because I want you to hear from some of the young leaders we work with. (Cheers, applause.) This is their friends and support group. (Laughter.) I thought we were going to drink later. (Laughter.) Did you guys get an early start? (Laughter.) What I do want to do, though, before I bring them out, is I want to just spend a few minutes sketching, in very broad strokes, some of the work that I believe lies ahead.<br><br>To begin with, we need to be clear that democracy is about more than elections. Most of us understand this, but I think we really have to continually focus in on this because we have seen, time and again, how the machinery of elections can be twisted to serve the interests of despots.<br><br>I believe a genuine democracy must be rooted in the core principle that all persons, regardless of their race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, physical capacity, economic status\u200a\u2014\u200aall persons have an inviolable dignity and worth, and that they are entitled to a say in how they are governed and deserve equal treatment in the eyes of the law. That to me is a core principle of democracy. (Applause.)<br><br>There was a time\u200a\u2014\u200aand the reason that it\u2019s important for us to say this is because there was as time, a long time\u200a\u2014\u200awhen countries could claim to be model democracies, despite the fact that they maintained effective caste systems, racial caste systems, religious caste systems, gender caste systems. They treated people differently, but they said, \u201cOh, we\u2019re model democracies.\u201d<br><br>No more. No democracy is perfect, and injustice is embedded in every society, we can acknowledge that, but any system of government that calls itself a democracy, while codifying injustice, violates the very essence of the word.<br><br>That\u2019s a core principle at the center of the democratic project, and this core principle has to be operationalized, yes, through free and fair elections, but also through institutions that guarantee basic rights like the freedom of speech and assembly and the ability to practice one\u2019s faith.<br><br>It needs institutions that ensure the equal administration of justice and promote transparency and establish a process to resolve differences and transfer power peacefully. That\u2019s what we mean by true democracy, a system in which \u201cWe the People\u201d includes all, and not just some, citizens. Now, within that, the particulars of any nation\u2019s constitution, political process, administrative machinery may vary based on custom or tradition, but I believe that the pursuit of the deeper value must be our North Star.<br><br>By those standards, some democracies are doing better than others. Collectively, we\u2019re all falling short. To build stronger democracies and beat back this trend towards authoritarianism, we will all need to raise our game, and I\u2019d suggest we focus on four broad areas.<br><br>Number one, for democracy to flourish, we need to develop models for a more inclusive and sustainable capitalism.<br><br>I believe in market economies, not just because they\u2019re more efficient and more innovative than other systems, so far devised, but because, when properly structured, they\u2019re compatible with freedom. Scandinavian countries including Denmark demonstrate that.<br><br>But I also believe that the version of capitalism that has come to dominate the global economy has also come to corrode democracy. When you have trillions of dollars move around the globe, in the blink of an eye, outside the control of any sovereign country, far-flung mega companies operating beyond the reach of national regulation or oversight or tax collection, without regard for their impact on local communities or workers, and unconstrained by any values other than their quarterly shareholder report, that\u2019s a lot of power outside of democracy.<br><br>We have to acknowledge, economically, this globalization has made products cheaper, increased interdependence, it has helped drive rapid development in some countries, most notably China. But it has also driven income inequality to levels not seen in generations. In wealthy countries, it\u2019s amplified the loss of bargaining power for workers, it\u2019s stunted wage growth, it\u2019s reduced the status of workers, maybe for all but a narrow band of people in the knowledge professions.<br><br>For some poorer countries, the shift towards automation and relentless foreign competition has actually made it harder to develop viable local industry and expand a fledgling middle class, and there\u2019s been a constant brain drain of educated and skilled workers.<br><br>And while China has emerged as a big winner in the globalization sweepstakes, using export-driven strategies to lift a huge swath of its population out of poverty, it\u2019s come at the price of increased, steady repression and control of its people, and a more aggressive nationalism on the world stage, especially as growth slows and the Chinese government may find it harder to meet peoples\u2019 rising expectations.<br><br>Now, these aren\u2019t conditions where democracy is likely to thrive. When people feel economically insecure, when they feel the game is rigged, anger mounts, resentment builds. When democratic governments can\u2019t respond to these frustrations, partly because they don\u2019t have control, over the tax revenues or the regulatory capacity to deal with the major players in the economy, people grow cynical towards their leaders and the political system that produced them.<br><br>When the gap between rich and poor widens, further and further, then fellow citizens share fewer experiences. The rich people are behind the gate somewhere, and the poor people are outside, and their kids are not going to school together, and they\u2019re not feeling invested in each other. Well, people feel fewer obligations, and social trust declines.<br><br>And in the absence of solidarity, people are more likely to turn to populist appeals from strongmen who offer someone to blame, whether it\u2019s immigrants or minorities or foreign powers or shadowy elites or opposition parties or even democracy itself.<br><br>So if we want to strengthen our democracies, we have to pay attention to economics, and we need to make the global economy more responsive to workers, families, communities, and representative governments. Some of this work on labor protections or corporate governance, on tax policies that reduce inequality, and investment where it\u2019s needed, some of that will happen at a local or national level.<br><br>Other strategies, like ending global tax avoidance and combating kleptocracy, require international cooperation. But our objectives should be clear: reducing the wealth gap, expanding middle classes, restoring peoples\u2019 sense of control over their own livelihoods, making private companies more accountable. We want them to make a profit, but also more accountable for the common good. That\u2019s number one.<br><br>Number two, we need to revitalize our political institutions so that people believe that participation is worth the effort.<br><br>In too many democracies, politics feels like a distant and increasingly irrelevant enterprise. Some of that is by design, by the way. In my own country, for example, we have what\u2019s called a filibuster rule in the United States Senate that has effectively made it almost impossible for either party, even when they have a majority, to get anything substantial through the Senate and passed and signed into law.<br><br>At a certain point, people start wondering, why bother?<br><br>We have governments making it too hard to vote, a lot of governments who make it difficult to see why your vote matters. The powerful seem to have more access. They act with impunity. Over time, the people and their elected representatives break down.<br><br>So every democracy has to take basic steps to restore confidence that democracy is working the way it\u2019s supposed to, like protecting the right to vote, ensuring that vote is counted equally and transparently, holding the powerful to account when they bend the rules or break the law, ending the scourge of dark money that so often corrupts our politics.<br><br>More than that, democracies need to redesign governments so that they can deliver better results. In some cases, that means stripping away bureaucracy and red tape, even when it\u2019s well-intentioned, which makes government unable to move on major initiatives. In the United States right now, building infrastructure, like mass transit or road projects or an airport, it costs like two or three times more than it does here in Europe! And in some cases, it means pushing more decision-making to the local and regional level, so we can road test new ideas to solve problems and build bridges between those in power and the people that they\u2019re supposed to represent, an issue here in Europe that has to be paid attention to. The bottom line is that people care about democratic process, but they also want results.<br><br>Third, we need to spend more time and energy building a democratic culture.<br><br>Those of us who promote democracy, we\u2019re often progressive. We focus a lot on policy. We see politics and governance as pluralistic negotiation between competing rational, self-interested actors. That\u2019s not what moves people in the world. Emotions matter. Stories matter. People care about meaning and purpose and belonging and status. And in this age of uncertainty and polarization, we\u2019ve seen the loss of many of the stabilizing foundations in peoples\u2019 lives, whether its neighborhoods that are disrupted or religious, cultural or civic organizations that are atrophying. Often, it\u2019s authoritarian leaders who understand this, and those of us who believe in democracy struggle to catch up. We avoid what in the United States we call \u201cculture wars\u201d because we want to focus on tax policy. But those emotions are powerful and they\u2019re legitimate. Purpose, meaning, connection. Those things do matter.<br><br>Now, I want to be clear, I have little sympathy for reactionaries who cynically condemn identity politics or cancel culture when really all they\u2019re doing is trying to preserve existing privileges, or excuse entrenched injustice or bigotry. I mean, the original identity politics is racism and sexism and homophobia, and that\u2019s nothing if not identity politics, and it\u2019s done a lot more harm than some tweet from and aggrieved Liberal.<br><br>But what is also true is that, if we\u2019re going to strengthen democracy, if we want to encourage pluralism and civility and self-governance, we have to embrace and restore a language of mutual respect that speaks to peoples\u2019 need for belonging, that they care about the traditions they come from, they care about the places they come from. They want to feel proud about who they are. And that\u2019s easier to do in homogeneous countries; it\u2019s harder to do as countries become more diverse.<br><br>So my point is, a big part of strengthening democracy is not just about politics and policy; it is about culture. And we have to embrace that. We have to expand the civic education that we provide our children and give them practice to live in a democracy. We have to create organizations that give them experience in working with people who are different, and exercise their civic muscles. We need to create platforms that encourage a willingness that nudge people and incentivize people to extend good faith to those who are not like themselves, or don\u2019t think like themselves, a politics that is inclusive rather than exclusive. This is both ethically sound and a practical necessity, something that leaders Gandhi, and King, and Mandela understood. There\u2019s a reason why Nelson Mandela really focused on South African rugby, when he was released. He was sending a signal to those who had imprisoned him for 27 years, that I\u2019m not here to take away your traditions and your identity, as long as you make sure they are compatible with my dignity and respect for my people. (Applause.)<br><br>We need to find ways to build that kind of solidarity and forge connections with people, so that they don\u2019t push us away. That doesn\u2019t mean we have to indulge traditions that don\u2019t live up to our core principles of equality and human dignity, but it does mean that we need to use language that affirms the best of existing national, religious, and culture and ethnic traditions, rather than make arguments that make people feel like they have to abandon all aspects of their past. We can reckon with our darker histories without asking people to reject their own identities. Indeed, progress is about doing the work of perfecting our unions, not repudiating the possibility of a union.<br><br>Finally, as we do all these things, we have to take steps to detoxify our discourse, particularly the scourge of disinformation and conspiracy theories, and hate online that has polluted our political discourse.<br><br>Now, I spoke about at length about this at Stanford University, in the spring, but I\u2019ll just reinforce a few key points. Technology companies have to accept a degree of democratic oversight and accountability. Profit can\u2019t be the only driver for platforms who have acquired power once reserved for nation-states. And while no human endeavor can eliminate human fallibility, we can actually make these things better. These technologies and platforms were made by human beings; human beings can make them work better.<br><br>I look forward to doing more work in the months to come to lift up and put forth new ideas around technology and the other areas that I just mentioned, because these are the areas where we all have to do better. It\u2019s going to determine the fate of our democracies, whether they stick, whether they get stronger, or whether they continue to get weaker.<br><br>But, although I\u2019m ready to volunteer and sign up, and work with existing groups and organizations that are focused in these areas, I want to underscore\u200a\u2014\u200aI\u2019m probably not going to be the main driver of solutions at this stage, nor are many of us in this room, who already\u200a\u2014\u200aI won\u2019t say are passed our primes, but we have gone through\u200a\u2014\u200arun through positions of power. Because we need to build democracy for the future, not the past.<br><br>And what gives me hope is the promise and potential of the next generation of leaders who are coming up, young people who understand that the future of democracy, and in fact, the very planet that we live on, hangs in the balance. These young people are ready to do the work, and many of them are already deeply engaged in the project of rebuilding our democracies.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s who Michelle and I are supporting at our Foundation, and that is why I\u2019m so glad to be joined by just a small sampling of our extraordinary Obama Foundation leaders from all across Europe, who gathered here today. If you can all please welcome, Tudor, Federica and Selvije. Come on\u00a0up.</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/f1747082849d11f26f6f17f0643ac7ee/href\">https://medium.com/media/f1747082849d11f26f6f17f0643ac7ee/href</a><p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> First of all, you can tell what outstanding young leaders they are because they already know you want to bring your own fans to events. (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Before we start our conversation, I would love for each of you very briefly to describe for the audience who you are, what you\u2019ve been doing, and why it\u2019s been so exciting for you to gather with some of the other leaders and peers from across\u00a0Europe.</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI:</strong> First of all, thank you very much, Mr. President, for having us here and thanks to all the Obama leaders out there, because it\u2019s really nice getting an audience with you\u00a0guys.</p>\n<p>My name is Federica Vinci. I am the deputy mayor of Isernia, which is a small town in the south of Italy. The work that I do is basically to try to bring back politics, grassroots politics in a very small town in my region and hopefully, in the future, in my\u00a0country.</p>\n<p>The best part of being here with all these amazing leaders has been having the chance to reconnect with people that do our same job, even if different fields. Sometimes it feels lonely when you are on the ground trying to make change, but reconnecting with all of you has been such a gift, because it reminds us why we\u2019re here and what our purpose is. So thank you very\u00a0much.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> Excellent. (Applause.)</p>\n<p>Tudor?</p>\n<p><strong>TUDOR IULIAN BRADATAN:</strong> Thank you very much. I\u2019m Tudor. I\u2019m from Romania. I am the executive director of what we call an online digital campaigning organization. We work on multi-issues, ranging from the environment to the rule of law. We have an online community with 1.2 million members. This is the people that receive constantly our updates and are invited to take action whenever is needed. We put pressure on decision-makers each time there is a good opportunity.</p>\n<p>We fundraise from our members and this is how we manage to actually win campaigns. Sometimes we fundraise for expensive lawsuits. Sometimes we fundraise for ads in newspapers to get our message\u00a0across.</p>\n<p>I chose this work because it\u2019s my way of defending democracy and it\u2019s my way to help people, simple people from all walks of life to have a say in today\u2019s democracy basically.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> Excellent. (Applause.)</p>\n<p>Selvije?</p>\n<p><strong>SELVIJE MUSTAFI:</strong> Thank you so much. My name is Selvije Mustafi. I\u2019m coming from North Macedonia and I\u2019m national grassroots organizer within the biggest Roma national movement in Macedonia named Avaja, which means we are\u00a0coming.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been active for ten years now from the age of 16 and our movement\u2019s purpose is to build power in the communities and articulate Roma\u2019s issues on higher national\u00a0level.</p>\n<p>And another thing is now that from our movement, we also built another seven national movements in seven different countries, and I serve as trainer trying to build the communities, build the structures, and build\u00a0power.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> Fantastic. (Applause.)</p>\n<p>All right. So we only have about 40 minutes. I want to start with an open-ended question because in my opening remarks, I said that, certainly for my grandparents, my parents, and to some degree for me, when I think about democracy and the tension between democracy and authoritarianism, my reference point is the Cold War. I think about, you know, I was in law school when the Berlin Wall came down. I\u2019m trying to do the math as to whether you were born when the Berlin Wall came down. (Laughter.) I don\u2019t think so,\u00a0right?</p>\n<p>I\u2019m interested, when we\u2019re here at this democratic summit, how do you and your peers think about this issue of democracy in your own countries here in Europe, worldwide? Do you have a sense of concern and worry that democracy is declining? Do you feel cynical about how existing democracies operate?</p>\n<p>Obviously, it\u2019s hard to generalize for everybody your age, but you\u2019re also having a lot of conversations with people who are active and care about\u00a0issues.</p>\n<p>Federica, you want to\u00a0start?</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI:</strong> Being the deputy mayor of a small town, it means that I get to have a lot of meetings with people of my age, but also younger, 15 years old, 16, 18 years old, boys and girls. I remember right after that I was elected and nominated deputy mayor, I\u2019m also in charge of youth policies. Coming from a community organizing background, I decided to call all the representatives of the different high schools of my hometown. We sat around the table and I asked them, so guys, tell me, how have you worked with politicians in the past? What have you guys done together or what has been done for\u00a0you?</p>\n<p>And well, before asking this question, the first thing that they said to me was, have we done anything\u00a0wrong?</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> Why are you calling me in here? Am I in\u00a0trouble?</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI:</strong> Why are you calling us here? Are we in trouble? This made me realize that these guys and these girls had never been listened to\u00a0before.</p>\n<p>When we were talking about politics, they were completely disillusioned, not because\u200a\u2014\u200aand I thought because they didn\u2019t have any luck for the future or they didn\u2019t have any thought about their jobs. But actually they were not even thinking about their future. They had never been listened to. They had never been involved in policymaking. Politicians were doing policies without involving them at all. So they were like, we don\u2019t see politicians. We don\u2019t hear from them. We just see them when they want our\u00a0votes.</p>\n<p>And I think that if we want\u200a\u2014\u200aof course we want democracy, right? We want our rights to be protected. We want our freedom. I don\u2019t think that anybody would exchange democracy for anything in the world. Yet we have to admit that democracy, at least in places like mine, is failing generations, like my generation or generations even\u00a0younger.</p>\n<p>So we as politicians, as leaders have a huge responsibility to go back into these places and make these boys, these girls part of the solution, part of this policymaking process, listen to them and engage\u00a0them.</p>\n<p>Because we are talking about huge numbers. Like Italy has around 8,000 municipalities. 180 municipalities are above 50,000 people. All the rest, more than 7,800 municipalities are really small towns where politicians can have a day-to-day engagement with their constituencies and with those kids. I think it\u2019s our job to do it because this is the only way we can infuse hope in them and in the future of democracy.</p>\n<p>(Applause.)</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> As I listen, I\u2019m going to think of new questions, and I\u2019ll give you a new question, Tudor, but you can answer the old question. Take it where you want. But as I was listening to Federica speaking, she mentioned online. One thing we know about young people, whether in Europe, the United States, Africa, anywhere in the world, a larger portion of their time, attention is on the phone or a\u00a0screen.</p>\n<p>I know that you have worked in thinking about how to use these new technologies to engage people rather than isolate them. What strategies have worked for you when it comes to engaging people online? But how does that also then translate into action in the real world? Because we have an expression in the United States, \u201chashtag activism,\u201d where somebody just tweets like or has a sarcastic comment about something and then kind of feels like, well, there was my political activism for the day. (Laughter.) But it never actually translates into voting, mobilization, initiatives that bring about change. What\u2019s your\u00a0sense?</p>\n<p><strong>TUDOR IULIAN BRADATAN:</strong> I would rather answer with an example. In our world, we always say that e-mail is dead. It\u2019s difficult to reach people via e-mail. And it\u2019s a very good solution because unlike social media, the e-mail is targeted. You have an e-mail address, you send an e-mail, the person receives the e-mail. With social media, it\u2019s much more complicated than that. And with these new networks that arise, it\u2019s hard for us to even find ways in which we can actually tap in with our messaging.</p>\n<p>The example I\u2019m going to give you is with a petition that was started on our website by the students in Romania. They asked for a modernization of the way in which they\u2019re evaluated. They go through the same evaluation that I went through when I went to high school or my sister that is ten years older than me, and it wasn\u2019t\u00a0changed.</p>\n<p>What they did is they signed a petition on our website, 400,000 of them, almost every kid in school in Romania signed a petition. We require an e-mail when people signed that petition. They created that e-mail in order to sign the petition, and we want to work with them together for the next\u00a0steps.</p>\n<p>What happened with that petition? The first time that it was submitted to the Minister of Education, he kind of mocked them. But then they came up with follow-up tactics. The last declaration of the minister is somewhat, \u201cI\u2019m going to think about it,\u201d but already I see them win that campaign. Even if it\u2019s going to take a little bit more time, the way in which they work together, the way in which they are creative to put pressure on decision-makers makes me have much more hope than I have in my generation, for instance.</p>\n<p>I would not treat these kinds of things as individual, things that are too individualistic. We have to work together. The students in Romania, they somehow managed to find ways in which they talked. They used the platform that last time I heard of it, it was for online gaming, people synchronizing on strategies, and they used that software. It was impressive for me to see how well that can be organized and how efficient they are. That is the one thing that brings me a lot of\u00a0hope.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> Selvije, Federica works very local. And you, on the other hand, are part of a European-wide network advocating on behalf of the Roma people. What do you see, what are the trends that you\u2019re seeing in terms of young people getting involved Europe-wide and how do they feel about European democracy?</p>\n<p>Because one of the interesting things about democracy in Europe, I remember when I was president coming here, you had local governments, you had regional governments, you had national governments. Then you had Brussels. You\u2019ve got the EU. You\u2019ve got the European Parliament. There are a bunch of different ways to access politics. But I\u2019m wondering, does that make it more difficult or more accessible for people to want to get involved and to feel like they have a hand in who\u2019s making decisions that affect their\u00a0lives?</p>\n<p><strong>SELVIJE MUSTAFI:</strong> I\u2019m going to start with the following, that democracy has always meant the same. It has meant the voice of the people, the power of the people, the decision of the\u00a0people.</p>\n<p>And what I see in my generation and their perception and feeling of democracy has two aspects. The first one is that the Roma community, in their mid-twenties or even younger, they are very disappointed in democracy in general, also in the approach of how some political leaders are responding to democracy and democratic ideals.</p>\n<p>This has different reasons, because for so long, the Roma in general were excluded economically, politically, culturally, and were underrepresented. They didn\u2019t have their own representative who is coming directly from the community, who knows the issues in the community and the challenges, and who can deliver and articulate and try to solve them. Because representatives who are non-Roma, they cannot know what is happening in the Roma community better than the\u00a0Roma.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, working for ten years now in the community, building power in the community and showing different approaches, like relationship building and so on, the community and the young people see a different added value. They can participate in public dialogs with politicians, with different political actors, with mayors and so on, and they see that this is an element that gives them, how to say, that gives them a value where they can contribute.</p>\n<p>What is the narrative now in the community and among the youngsters? What I hear is, well, maybe we are, because we are the biggest ethnic minority in Europe with over 12 million Roma, maybe we are a key contributor to preserve democracy. And with all the painful, painful history and survivals that we had in the past, now we are still here and we are courageous and brave to take action. And that\u2019s what democracy is about, about bravery, an effort that will bring bigger\u00a0changes.</p>\n<p>(Cheers, applause.)</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> Excellent.</p>\n<p>All those people clapping up there, many of them are working on different issues. The three of you are working on different issues. One of the challenges for democracy in the United States is sometimes people become very narrow in the issues that they\u2019re concerned about. Climate change, that\u2019s a very complicated issue. Criminal justice reform is very detailed.</p>\n<p>Organizations, activists, even elected officials sometimes work narrowly, but in order to build power and actually move the levers of democracy, it\u2019s a huge advantage if you can form coalitions across\u00a0groups.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m wondering, how have you been thinking about in your own work or in conversations that you\u2019ve been having, the need to work across sectors or how do you think about the relationship between working in non-profits versus running for office? Always a difficult debate, I think, does change come more from the inside or from the outside, beating down the door? How have you been thinking about\u00a0that?</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI:</strong> We were just laughing because we were having this discussion 15 minutes\u00a0ago.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> Were you encouraging Tudor to run for something?</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI:</strong> Exactly, run for office,\u00a0yes.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> He\u2019s a very handsome guy. I think he could do\u00a0well.</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI:</strong> I\u2019m trying. I\u2019m trying really hard. But it\u2019s like he wants to be convinced.</p>\n<p>What I believe is that we need way more cross-sectional politics in general, but way more engagement in different sectors. Yes, there are tons of challenges. First of all, generally, as we were saying, activists do not want to run for office. This is what I\u2019m trying to change from the very bottom, because I believe that we have generally attached a very negative meaning to politics.</p>\n<p>While politics is the air we breathe, politics is in every single thing we do. It\u2019s in the transportations that we take, it\u2019s in the climate, it\u2019s in the way we engage with people, it\u2019s in the way we speak, how we are educated; politics is everything. So whenever someone tells me, \u201cOh, politics is bad, politics is corrupted, politics is full of scandals,\u201d I reply, \u201cThis is what governs your life.\u201d If this is what governs your life, do you really want to be governed by the worst people that you think are getting there? And we are electing them in democracies.</p>\n<p>So what I don\u2019t understand and what we were discussing about is that we talk a lot about democracy, but then especially in countries like mine, in places like mine, we have the lowest standards for the people that then get up in the parliament and write these laws for\u00a0us.</p>\n<p>I think that if we really want to change things, we need more people that have super-high moral standards and that want to change things from the grassroots to the top level to get engaged into politics and get elected. Because it\u2019s true that you can get an amazing amount of change as an activist.</p>\n<p>I was an activist before becoming a politician. I was a community organizer.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> Me, too. (Laughter, applause.)</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI:</strong> And I think I still want to be an activist. I want to be an activist. I want to get out and rally for climate change or I want to get out with my people and clean parks, if we need\u00a0to.</p>\n<p>But we cannot avoid thinking that politics is not part of the game. Politics is part of the game. Politics will always be part of the game. And if we don\u2019t think that we don\u2019t have to get engaged, then we will keep being governed by the people that we don\u2019t like, even though we vote for them. And then we have voter apathy and we have kids not going to vote and we have people getting way, way far away from politics, while this still governs our\u00a0life.</p>\n<p>This has to change and I am arguing that this needs to change from the very bottom where people like me, politicians, can start talking face to face with their constituency and regaining the trust that they\u2019ve lost so far because they have been governed by the wrong people, because the right one were just too scared of the bad environment that politics brings up\u00a0on.</p>\n<p>(Cheers, applause.)</p>\n<p><strong>TUDOR IULIAN BRADATAN:</strong> Almost convinced me, but no. I have resistance still.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> I\u2019m not going to put you on the spot today and ask you to announce your candidacy, but this goes to the issues of this summit. It\u2019s often easy to defend democracy in the abstract. But if you have been an activist and you\u2019ve been working from the outside, sometimes it is difficult to see why change is moving so slowly on the inside. As I said in my remarks, some of that is by\u00a0design.</p>\n<p>As somebody who started locally and then ended up running a pretty big government, a lot of the activists who worked with me would get frustrated and think somehow that, well, how come he hasn\u2019t gotten this done or that done yet? It must be because he no longer cares about us. He\u2019s talking to all these rich contributors and this and that. When, in fact, no, I still want exactly what you wanted, but the wheels of government are just moving very slowly because there are all these systems that are set up to block\u00a0it.</p>\n<p>The reason I say that is because I think for democracy to work, you have to have both. You have to have people who are in the engine room and the deck of the ship of democracy, working to make it move in the right direction, but you also have to have people on the outside who are constantly maintaining pressure and getting people involved, because that\u2019s the engine, that\u2019s the fuel that ultimately is going to get you to where you want to\u00a0go.</p>\n<p>And so, I\u2019m interested in how\u200a\u2014\u200aas I said, Tudor, you don\u2019t have to announce your candidacy.</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI:</strong> Not\u00a0yet.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> Because there is an important role to play in citizen participation, activism, organization. And so far, that\u2019s the role you\u2019ve chosen to play. Do you feel like you can make enough of a difference taking that approach, particularly if maybe sometimes you see\u200a\u2014\u200ayou said like the education minister seemed like he\u2019s not listening to 400,000 students. Do you think, \u201cyou know what, we should have somebody in there who does\u00a0listen?\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>TUDOR IULIAN BRADATAN:</strong> It\u2019s a big temptation for many activists to go into politics, and I admire those who do. It\u2019s not a matter of me thinking that politics is dirty and we should not touch it. No, politics is where decisions are\u00a0made.</p>\n<p>My fear is that, if people like me enter politics, we leave an empty spot in the civil society, and that supporting a country like Romania was difficult to fill in the first place. We are a young democracy. If all of us from the civil society turn into politics, we need to bring new people to form this new civil society. What I noticed in my line of work is that politicians become better when we demand them to do\u00a0so.</p>\n<p>Now, I think that in a way, the civil society is like that bad medicine that tastes bad, but you still need to take it because it makes you healthy. I like to be that medicine that tastes bad. It makes me feel better. (Laughter, applause.) But if I would get one single dollar each time I\u2019m invited to join politics, I would solve the funding for my organization for ten years. (Laughter.)</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> Let me start with you on this question, Selvije. We talked about online organizing, but one of the things that I do think has changed, even since I was in office, was the amount of misinformation, the difficulty of sorting between what\u2019s true and what\u2019s false, what\u2019s journalism and what\u2019s fabrication.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m wondering how all of you in the work that you try to do have dealt with the misinformation problem, whether it affects your work and whether you\u2019ve come up with some solutions, so that you can get facts and information out to people and you don\u2019t have to spend all your time refuting things that people think that aren\u2019t true, and in some cases politicize issues that shouldn\u2019t be political.</p>\n<p>In the United States, as I think many of you saw, COVID became somehow a political issue and getting vaccinated or wearing masks. A lot of that was driven just by misinformation that was out there, and that seems to be happening on more and more issues. I\u2019m wondering how it\u2019s affected you and whether you\u2019ve seen some solutions to help young people distinguish between what\u2019s true and false in making decisions about how to participate and what to\u00a0support.</p>\n<p><strong>SELVIJE MUSTAFI:</strong> Yes, definitely digital, the digital space has fundamentally altered on how people are being exposed to engage with information. And I think that the internet has enabled a lot of people to create and expand different kinds of content by a large audience at marginal costs, and it\u2019s instantly and freely accessible.</p>\n<p>However, there are big concerns also in our movement about how false information and misinformation is spreading on the internet to influence decisions by some political actors or political sides. So using the social media, you can create, and you can expand different kinds of misinformation.</p>\n<p>And as you said, the challenge is that those kind of fake news and misinformation are making the people to have a different kind of opinion, which is not necessarily relevant or truthful. And this is an issue we have also with the Roma community, a community who has been discriminated for so long, ignored. It\u2019s very easy. There is a big base to spread fake news and to make them think like that, and not necessarily they can now differentiate what is opinion and what is\u00a0fact.</p>\n<p>So what we do as activists, as movements, and\u200a\u2014\u200aI mean, what we what we can\u2019t do is we cannot\u200a\u2014\u200awe don\u2019t have the space and tools how to regulate the internet, but what we can do is to try to counteract this kind of false news and to try to actively produce content that is relevant and spread the frequency of our own message and our own narrative.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA: </strong>Excellent. Frederica, as an elected officials and activist, is that a problem that you\u2019ve seen in terms of the work that you\u2019re doing? Do you find you make a proposal, and somebody says, \u201cWell, you know, I just saw on the internet that what you\u2019re doing is going to cause cancer,\u201d or it\u2019s going to, you know, destroy the economy or something? And then you have to spend a lot of time unwinding some of\u00a0this?</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI: </strong>Yeah, and exactly, words like this. I really\u200a\u2014\u200alike a simple example, the cost of energy and the cost of water, they rose because of the war, yet we had a couple of newspapers saying that, since\u200a\u2014\u200athat we were getting paid by the taxpayer money of this increase in water and\u00a0energy.</p>\n<p>So it obviously is false, and it obviously should be easier to think about it, because it\u2019s like the war, and it\u2019s something way above us. Yet, what comes out there, and even what I notice is that it\u2019s even easier for people to get out this false news and this false noise, and it\u2019s\u00a0scary.</p>\n<p>So, and it\u2019s not just about that. It\u2019s about rumors that get out. It\u2019s about voices, rumors, like people talking to people. So in a very small town, you have a huge amount of rumors coming out, and our question was like, how do we counteract against it? What do we\u00a0do?</p>\n<p>So of course you can work online, but in such a small town, and again, Italy is full, and I guess also Europe, it\u2019s full of such small places. You can have a real confrontation with your constituencies.</p>\n<p>So we\u2019ve started having town halls in like open-air tunnels, and now that it\u2019s summer and COVID is not such a big risk, especially outside. And we\u2019ve asked people to join us in sharing with us their fears, their questions, what they want, how can we answer to their problems?</p>\n<p>And the first time, nobody asked questions. It was really weird, but then\u00a0\u2013</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA: </strong>Everybody just sat there for half-an-hour?</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI: </strong>Yeah, exactly, so we started talking about our policies, but then\u200a\u2014\u200ayeah, but then, on our policies, they started asking questions. And many of the were really good questions. We see a lot of anger on Facebook, a lot of anger on social media. And when you go in real life, first of all, this anger is not that bad, but second, it has a motive. It has a\u00a0reason.</p>\n<p>And when you meet your people and you can ask them, you can listen to them, you actually know what those reasons are, and you can give them answers. And not only, I think we should give them answers, but I think we should include them in the decision-making process and the implementation of the policies that we bring\u00a0about.</p>\n<p>So to counteract this fake news environment in the small town, I guess that the real solution is coming back on the ground, the grassroots, meeting with people, answering their questions, involving them and making them part of the changes that we want to see\u00a0around.</p>\n<p>(Applause.)</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA: </strong>Excellent. So we\u2019re coming to the end of our session here, and I want to give you a two-part question. If you ever decide to run for office, this is how reporters get around it. They\u2019re only supposed to get one question, that is, \u201cSir, I have a five-part question,\u201d and then they go and tick them off, and so I\u2019m going to use the trick they taught me. And you can answer both, either one, or just don\u2019t answer, which is also a strategy that I taught them. (Laughter.) And talk about what I want to talk\u00a0about.</p>\n<p>I opened with my remarks, and obviously an enormous amount of time has been spent at this summit, talking about the tragedy of what\u2019s happening in Ukraine. And I\u2019m wondering how you think this has affected you, your generation, to witness this kind of crisis in the heart of Europe in a way that harkens back to your grandparents\u2019 generation. It\u2019s been a long time since we saw that much violence, and now we can witness in real time and displacement. So I\u2019m curious how has it impacted you and your friends? How do you talk about it? And does it encourage you to see the response and make you more committed to the public work that you\u2019re doing? So that\u2019s one question.</p>\n<p>Part two, because we\u2019re running out of time, is what are the things that do inspire you and keep you going? Because I think, whether it\u2019s you Frederica or Tudor, but I know you all feel it, sometimes the work gets lonely. And sometimes democracy is discouraging. What is it that has kept that optimism and hope going even when you confront setbacks and when you feel like democracy\u2019s not working? So why don\u2019t we start then with\u00a0you.</p>\n<p><strong>SELVIJE MUSTAFI: </strong>Well, I think that the recent context and situation has affected generally the youth and in particular in the Roma community in many aspects, in many ways, psychologically, financially. And there is a lot of frustration.</p>\n<p>And as a matter of fact, in Ukraine, there are a lot of Roma. There is a big Roma community who has also been put aside and discriminated for so long. But yet again, the Roma who are there are fighting for Ukraine, and they are fighting for\u00a0freedom.</p>\n<p>So I hope the war ends as soon as possible. And I hope that after the war, Roma won\u2019t be forgotten.</p>\n<p>What really inspires me, because for so long the narrative towards us was negative. Many, much of stigma, negative perception, and big part of the Roma community accepted that. But going into the community, talking to people, working with people, and seeing how much of a big potential the Roma are, and how much of a big capacity we have, this is what really inspires me and drives\u00a0me.</p>\n<p>And this is something that I felt from the very beginning of my activism, 10 years ago, and I still feel it whenever I go to the community. And I think that this is the new generation of a driving change. And a community who can preserve democracy and who can be part of preserving democracy in the next period, and I hope, I really hope that Europe, European stakeholders and institutions will have more openness towards Roma and more inclusiveness in particular.</p>\n<p>(Applause.)</p>\n<p><strong>TUDOR IULIAN BRADATAN: </strong>When you asked me about\u200a\u2014\u200alike, how do I see democracy now, it made me realize that I\u2019m\u200a\u2014\u200ain my family, I\u2019m the first generation that lived their young years in peace and democracy. My parents, they lived theirs in the Cold War. My grandparents fought in World War II. My great-grandparents fought in World War\u00a0I.</p>\n<p>And so I am the first one, basically, that lived to see democracy. Now, I\u2019m not that young. I have gray hair. I still can hide it underneath the other parts. And I still remember the days in Romania when we were a dictatorship. I was very young, but there are things that still are very strong memories, the queues to go and buy food, the heaters that were cold in the\u00a0winter.</p>\n<p>I do not want to go back that. And for many years I thought that, for instance, war is something that is unthinkable, and after 2014, it became obvious that war is again a thing in Europe. And it scares me. And that\u2019s the reality. But that\u2019s what\u200a\u2014\u200aI mean, when we get paralyzed with fear, that\u2019s when they win. Fear is not really an option for us, because I do not want to go back to the days when Romania was a dictatorship. I do not want to see those atrocities happen\u00a0again.</p>\n<p>So I will fight with everything I have to keep the democracy going and make sure that this system, as imperfect as it is, keeps on going because it is the only thing that allows me to be in places like this to meet the amazing leaders that I met in the last few days. And meeting you is something that would have been unthinkable for my parents\u2019 generation.</p>\n<p>So we have to defend this because what would come next is unimaginable.</p>\n<p>(Applause.)</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA: </strong>Madam Mayor, you get the last word\u00a0here.</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI: </strong>When it comes to Ukraine, I still remember the day of the war, and I remember calling my friends in\u200a\u2014\u200aI mean, we were all shocked, and it was something that lasted for a while. Like we had that punch in the stomach. We couldn\u2019t think about what was happening. We couldn\u2019t think about the fact that we were\u200a\u2014\u200alike that our borders, like Ukraine, which we consider Europe, were at\u00a0war.</p>\n<p>And we are like a really big European generation, and so we felt extremely attacked, sad, lost, somehow. But on the other hand, it was also sort of a wake-up call, a reminder that, in Italy, at least in my town, and in my region, we are still lucky enough to be able to keep working on our democracy, that it\u2019s not working as we would like it to be. It\u2019s not being like we would like it to\u00a0be.</p>\n<p>So that, that brings me to the point of what is it that is passionate for me, and moves me, especially when you live in a town where, in front of you, you don\u2019t have just your political opponent, but probably the woman who stole your boyfriend when you were 15 years old and you still haven\u2019t forgotten.</p>\n<p>(Laughter.)</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA: </strong>That\u2019s a good point. I mean, that\u2019s\u200a\u2014\u200aif it\u2019s, you know, that makes it a little more personal.</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI:\u00a0</strong>Exactly.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA: </strong>You\u2019re, no\u200a\u2014\u200aI wasn\u2019t pointing. She\u2019s not here. I was pretending that I was pointing (laughter).</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI: </strong>But it gets harder because you want to do stuff, and you know that you can\u2019t move on because probably there is something personal behind it. So how do you do it? And this is also what gave me\u00a0hope.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll tell you, like a short story. I have been working with this woman\u200a\u2014\u200anot working, but I would have loved to have worked with this woman, but since I\u2019ve gotten elected, she\u2019s been opposing every single thing that I try to propose, from the football court for the kids, from a youth center, and with no reason, I couldn\u2019t understand why.</p>\n<p>So one day I went into the local high school to talk to the youth of the local high school, and I was talking to them about the fact that my mom wanted me to become a lawyer. My dad wanted me to become a consultant. I tried both, I hated them both. And then I got into politics, which was my\u00a0dream.</p>\n<p>And I told these kids that we live in a society that doesn\u2019t give us the space to understand who we are, what we love, and what we want to do. So it\u2019s their job and our job as politicians to support them in finding the space and allowing them to become what they\u00a0want.</p>\n<p>Great speech. I went back home, slept on it. The morning after, I receive a call. It was this woman, and she said, \u201cLook, my daughter was on the stage and was listening to you, and she filmed you, and she sent me the recording. And I wanted to thank you because my story is your story with the difference that I didn\u2019t have the courage that you had to follow my own dreams. And having you out there talking to my daughter about the fact that you did gave my daughter the confidence to come to me and say that she wanted to become an architect. So thank you very much. I\u2019m looking forward to work with you on this youth\u00a0center.\u201d</p>\n<p>(Applause.)</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA: </strong>That\u2019s\u00a0great.</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI: </strong>Knowing that, beyond being politicians, we are human beings that share stories, and at the end of the day, we all want this world to be a better place, that\u2019s what gives me hope, because I see, every single day, that we can overcome our differences. We can build bridges. We can close the gap between the politicians, the high school girls that had a fight over a boyfriend. And we can unite on what really matters for us. And this gives me a lot of\u00a0hope.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA: </strong>Good. Well, you\u200a\u2014\u200athe three of you give me hope. The young people who are working with us at the Foundation are giving us hope. For those of you who are already parts of organizations working on democratic issues, either here or on other continents, I cannot tell you enough that we have to invest in this cohort if we are going to succeed. Because every time I have a chance to have conversations, the kind of idealism and innovation and imagination and courage that you\u2019ve heard from these three, they\u2019re out there. And they need to be heard, and they need to be empowered, because they\u2019re going to be the ones who take us where we need to\u00a0go.</p>\n<p>All right. Please give them a big round of applause. Thank you, everybody. Thank\u00a0you.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=e9740dc78c5a\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n","content":"\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*qsgZfzUTqkYPyymgEPSbWg.jpeg\"></figure><p><em>Today, I spoke at the </em><a href=\"https://www.obama.org/copenhagen-2022/\"><em>Copenhagen Democracy Summit in Denmark</em></a><em> to discuss the importance of a positive vision for democracy, and the promise of the next generation to chart a better\u00a0course.</em></p>\n<p>Thank you. Thank you. Well, thank you, Sahra-Josephine, for that introduction, and the extraordinary work that you are doing. And I want to thank my old friend, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, for hosting me and our extraordinary Obama Foundation leaders here today. It is wonderful to see all of you and I\u2019m confident that there have been extraordinary discussions that have been taking place since this conference began.<br><br>As we meet, Ukraine obviously weighs heavily on our hearts and minds. We\u2019ve all witnessed the terrible suffering in a war that recalls Europe\u2019s darkest history. But we have also witnessed the Ukrainian peoples\u2019 heroic resistance to Russian aggression. They\u2019ve united to defend not just their sovereignty, but their democratic identity, and their actions have rallied much of the world behind the values of self-determination and human dignity. It\u2019s inspiring.<br><br>Because of the courage and because of this solidarity on display, Vladimir Putin is failing to achieve his aims inside of Ukraine and beyond. NATO has stepped up and has grown stronger. Finland and Sweden are seeking swift accession. Countries have welcomed displaced Ukrainians with open arms. Meanwhile, Russia is cut off from resources and revenue, and many of its best and brightest have left, a blow to its present, but also to its future.<br><br>So we should take heart from Ukrainian resolve and from renewed transatlantic solidarity, and I know that\u2019s been discussed at this conference. These are signs of hope amidst despair. But make no mistake: this war is far from over. The costs will continue to mount. The course of events, as Anders and I discussed before we came out, are hard to predict. And our support for Ukraine must remain strong, steadfast and sustained until this conflict reaches a resolution.<br><br>Now, while Ukraine properly commands our immediate attention, it\u2019s also important to recognize that Putin\u2019s lawlessness is not happening in isolation. As I\u2019m sure previous speakers have noted, on every continent, we are seeing democratic backsliding. On every continent, emboldened autocrats are ramping up oppression, they\u2019re targeting minority groups, they\u2019re often flouting international law. Just as disturbing, within democracies, populist appeals grounded in fear and bigotry and resentment, have elevated leaders who, once they\u2019re in office, have sought to systematically undermine democratic institutions and entrench themselves in power. In my own country, the forces that unleashed mob violence on our Capitol are still churning out misinformation and conspiracy theories.<br><br>For those of us who fervently believe in the ideals of democracy, the question is: How do we\u00a0respond?</p>\n<p>If nothing else, recent events should shake us out of complacency. There was a trend after the fall of the Berlin Wall, a sense that history was inevitably going to usher in a democratic world. Well, we\u2019ve been reminded that democratic practice, democracy is neither inevitable nor self-executing. Most of recorded history is a chronicle of violence, and ignorance, and conflict; of strong nations subjugating weak nations, of groups using tribe, or race, or gender, or religion to justify dominion over others, to grant land and territory and resources. Sometimes they do it just because they can. Democracy, by contrast, has for most of human history been the anomaly. And in a relatively small period of time, in fits and starts. Through revolution, struggle, and sacrifice, democracy took hold in a few places, and then began in fits and starts, to spread, elsewhere in the globe. That expansion has helped contain some of humanity\u2019s baser impulses. But those instincts, those impulses were never eliminated, nor were the old structures of privilege and exploitation that they produced.<br><br>So the point is, if we want democracy to flourish, we will have to fight for it, we will have to nurture it, we will have to demonstrate its value, again and again, in improving the lives of ordinary people. And we will also have to be willing to look squarely at the shortcomings of our own democracies, not the ideal, but the reality of our own democracies. Only then will we be able to tell a better story of what democracy can be, and must be, in this rapidly changing world.<br><br>Now, for some of us, certainly those attending this conference, particularly those of you with gray hair like me, the virtues of democracy may seem obvious. For those generations scarred by successive World Wars, it was clear where dictatorship and master race theories and religious intolerance, and rampant nationalism could lead, because we\u2019d seen it here in Europe and elsewhere in the world, with bombed out cities and broken lives, as many as sixty million dead worldwide during World War II, Auschwitz, Stalin\u2019s gulags. For the Allies who emerged victorious, the goal was to prevent a repeat of such tragic history. So they built institutions to check unbridled power and to protect civil society and to foster pluralism. And they realized, well, if we\u2019re going to fight this battle, maybe we have to fix some of the things in our own democracies and make them more representative, make our hypocrisy, the gap between our words and our deeds, less obvious. Internationally they erected a multilateral system to reinforce international norms, recognize universal rights, and encourage the peaceful resolution of disputes.<br><br>As imperfect as these institutions were, most people during this period understood, to paraphrase Churchill, that democracy beat the alternatives. Two cheers for democracy. The notion was that democracy might not prevent every foolish war, but it made them less likely. Democracy might not end poverty and racism, but it could make things better. And, in fact, progress was real. But it was also incomplete.<br><br>That was a long time ago. I\u2019m now 60, and it happened before I was around. Most of the people alive on the earth today don\u2019t have that as a reference point.<br><br>Today, abstract appeals about democracy won\u2019t persuade the jobless youth on the outskirts of Paris, may not persuade families in Northern England struggling to pay the bills, or the displaced workers in the former factory towns of the American Midwest. And they barely register with the hundreds of millions of people trapped in poverty around the world.<br><br>A few weeks ago, I met with some young leaders who\u2019d just completed one of our Obama Foundation programs. We were in New York City. One of the participants was a remarkable young African who built an organization that expands educational opportunities for underserved youth, and he asked me a question. He said, \u201cPresident Obama, how do I answer my peers who argue that democracy in our country has failed to deliver? Everywhere, we see corruption, poverty, a lack of progress, despite election after election. When my peers look at China,\u201d he said, \u201cthey see a model of orderly advancement and material improvement in peoples\u2019 lives. So even if it means restrictions on some freedoms, isn\u2019t that worth the trade-offs?\u201d<br><br>Instinctively, I pointed out that the same system in China that his friends were praising now had let millions die of starvation and produced the chaos of the Cultural Revolution. I told the young man that he was too young to remember what life was like in his own country, before democracy came, that there had been a brutal civil war that also resulted in the death of millions, chronic corruption and then strife under subsequent military regimes. So I told him, \u201cYou need to broaden your lens,\u201d and he listened politely. What was he going to do? Maybe he was even moved by my arguments, but you could tell he didn\u2019t think his peers would be, at least not until those arguments were accompanied by measurable changes in their lives, where they live, in the here and now, not by reference to what happened 30 or 40 or 50 years ago.<br><br>I\u2019m convinced some version of this conversation is taking place right now in every country and on every continent. I\u2019m also convinced that, for us to win that contest of ideas between those of us who believe in democracy and those who are convinced that older ways of doing business are better, in that contest of ideas, it won\u2019t be enough to just say what we\u2019re against. We have to describe clearly what we are for. It won\u2019t be enough to reaffirm a creaky status quo, to just put a new coat of paint on the existing order, because the fact is, that order has been shaken at its foundations by globalization, financial crisis and social media, by rising inequality and mass migration, and climate change and a multi-polar world. If we are going to fortify democracy, if democracy is going to thrive and not just survive in a few pockets on the map, we are going to have to rebuild our democracies and our institutions, so they work better for more people for this new age.<br><br>Now, I\u2019m not here to offer a ten-point plan. I\u2019m no longer running for office. (Laughter.) Also, I don\u2019t have all the answers. Mainly I\u2019m not here to offer a ten-point place because I want you to hear from some of the young leaders we work with. (Cheers, applause.) This is their friends and support group. (Laughter.) I thought we were going to drink later. (Laughter.) Did you guys get an early start? (Laughter.) What I do want to do, though, before I bring them out, is I want to just spend a few minutes sketching, in very broad strokes, some of the work that I believe lies ahead.<br><br>To begin with, we need to be clear that democracy is about more than elections. Most of us understand this, but I think we really have to continually focus in on this because we have seen, time and again, how the machinery of elections can be twisted to serve the interests of despots.<br><br>I believe a genuine democracy must be rooted in the core principle that all persons, regardless of their race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, physical capacity, economic status\u200a\u2014\u200aall persons have an inviolable dignity and worth, and that they are entitled to a say in how they are governed and deserve equal treatment in the eyes of the law. That to me is a core principle of democracy. (Applause.)<br><br>There was a time\u200a\u2014\u200aand the reason that it\u2019s important for us to say this is because there was as time, a long time\u200a\u2014\u200awhen countries could claim to be model democracies, despite the fact that they maintained effective caste systems, racial caste systems, religious caste systems, gender caste systems. They treated people differently, but they said, \u201cOh, we\u2019re model democracies.\u201d<br><br>No more. No democracy is perfect, and injustice is embedded in every society, we can acknowledge that, but any system of government that calls itself a democracy, while codifying injustice, violates the very essence of the word.<br><br>That\u2019s a core principle at the center of the democratic project, and this core principle has to be operationalized, yes, through free and fair elections, but also through institutions that guarantee basic rights like the freedom of speech and assembly and the ability to practice one\u2019s faith.<br><br>It needs institutions that ensure the equal administration of justice and promote transparency and establish a process to resolve differences and transfer power peacefully. That\u2019s what we mean by true democracy, a system in which \u201cWe the People\u201d includes all, and not just some, citizens. Now, within that, the particulars of any nation\u2019s constitution, political process, administrative machinery may vary based on custom or tradition, but I believe that the pursuit of the deeper value must be our North Star.<br><br>By those standards, some democracies are doing better than others. Collectively, we\u2019re all falling short. To build stronger democracies and beat back this trend towards authoritarianism, we will all need to raise our game, and I\u2019d suggest we focus on four broad areas.<br><br>Number one, for democracy to flourish, we need to develop models for a more inclusive and sustainable capitalism.<br><br>I believe in market economies, not just because they\u2019re more efficient and more innovative than other systems, so far devised, but because, when properly structured, they\u2019re compatible with freedom. Scandinavian countries including Denmark demonstrate that.<br><br>But I also believe that the version of capitalism that has come to dominate the global economy has also come to corrode democracy. When you have trillions of dollars move around the globe, in the blink of an eye, outside the control of any sovereign country, far-flung mega companies operating beyond the reach of national regulation or oversight or tax collection, without regard for their impact on local communities or workers, and unconstrained by any values other than their quarterly shareholder report, that\u2019s a lot of power outside of democracy.<br><br>We have to acknowledge, economically, this globalization has made products cheaper, increased interdependence, it has helped drive rapid development in some countries, most notably China. But it has also driven income inequality to levels not seen in generations. In wealthy countries, it\u2019s amplified the loss of bargaining power for workers, it\u2019s stunted wage growth, it\u2019s reduced the status of workers, maybe for all but a narrow band of people in the knowledge professions.<br><br>For some poorer countries, the shift towards automation and relentless foreign competition has actually made it harder to develop viable local industry and expand a fledgling middle class, and there\u2019s been a constant brain drain of educated and skilled workers.<br><br>And while China has emerged as a big winner in the globalization sweepstakes, using export-driven strategies to lift a huge swath of its population out of poverty, it\u2019s come at the price of increased, steady repression and control of its people, and a more aggressive nationalism on the world stage, especially as growth slows and the Chinese government may find it harder to meet peoples\u2019 rising expectations.<br><br>Now, these aren\u2019t conditions where democracy is likely to thrive. When people feel economically insecure, when they feel the game is rigged, anger mounts, resentment builds. When democratic governments can\u2019t respond to these frustrations, partly because they don\u2019t have control, over the tax revenues or the regulatory capacity to deal with the major players in the economy, people grow cynical towards their leaders and the political system that produced them.<br><br>When the gap between rich and poor widens, further and further, then fellow citizens share fewer experiences. The rich people are behind the gate somewhere, and the poor people are outside, and their kids are not going to school together, and they\u2019re not feeling invested in each other. Well, people feel fewer obligations, and social trust declines.<br><br>And in the absence of solidarity, people are more likely to turn to populist appeals from strongmen who offer someone to blame, whether it\u2019s immigrants or minorities or foreign powers or shadowy elites or opposition parties or even democracy itself.<br><br>So if we want to strengthen our democracies, we have to pay attention to economics, and we need to make the global economy more responsive to workers, families, communities, and representative governments. Some of this work on labor protections or corporate governance, on tax policies that reduce inequality, and investment where it\u2019s needed, some of that will happen at a local or national level.<br><br>Other strategies, like ending global tax avoidance and combating kleptocracy, require international cooperation. But our objectives should be clear: reducing the wealth gap, expanding middle classes, restoring peoples\u2019 sense of control over their own livelihoods, making private companies more accountable. We want them to make a profit, but also more accountable for the common good. That\u2019s number one.<br><br>Number two, we need to revitalize our political institutions so that people believe that participation is worth the effort.<br><br>In too many democracies, politics feels like a distant and increasingly irrelevant enterprise. Some of that is by design, by the way. In my own country, for example, we have what\u2019s called a filibuster rule in the United States Senate that has effectively made it almost impossible for either party, even when they have a majority, to get anything substantial through the Senate and passed and signed into law.<br><br>At a certain point, people start wondering, why bother?<br><br>We have governments making it too hard to vote, a lot of governments who make it difficult to see why your vote matters. The powerful seem to have more access. They act with impunity. Over time, the people and their elected representatives break down.<br><br>So every democracy has to take basic steps to restore confidence that democracy is working the way it\u2019s supposed to, like protecting the right to vote, ensuring that vote is counted equally and transparently, holding the powerful to account when they bend the rules or break the law, ending the scourge of dark money that so often corrupts our politics.<br><br>More than that, democracies need to redesign governments so that they can deliver better results. In some cases, that means stripping away bureaucracy and red tape, even when it\u2019s well-intentioned, which makes government unable to move on major initiatives. In the United States right now, building infrastructure, like mass transit or road projects or an airport, it costs like two or three times more than it does here in Europe! And in some cases, it means pushing more decision-making to the local and regional level, so we can road test new ideas to solve problems and build bridges between those in power and the people that they\u2019re supposed to represent, an issue here in Europe that has to be paid attention to. The bottom line is that people care about democratic process, but they also want results.<br><br>Third, we need to spend more time and energy building a democratic culture.<br><br>Those of us who promote democracy, we\u2019re often progressive. We focus a lot on policy. We see politics and governance as pluralistic negotiation between competing rational, self-interested actors. That\u2019s not what moves people in the world. Emotions matter. Stories matter. People care about meaning and purpose and belonging and status. And in this age of uncertainty and polarization, we\u2019ve seen the loss of many of the stabilizing foundations in peoples\u2019 lives, whether its neighborhoods that are disrupted or religious, cultural or civic organizations that are atrophying. Often, it\u2019s authoritarian leaders who understand this, and those of us who believe in democracy struggle to catch up. We avoid what in the United States we call \u201cculture wars\u201d because we want to focus on tax policy. But those emotions are powerful and they\u2019re legitimate. Purpose, meaning, connection. Those things do matter.<br><br>Now, I want to be clear, I have little sympathy for reactionaries who cynically condemn identity politics or cancel culture when really all they\u2019re doing is trying to preserve existing privileges, or excuse entrenched injustice or bigotry. I mean, the original identity politics is racism and sexism and homophobia, and that\u2019s nothing if not identity politics, and it\u2019s done a lot more harm than some tweet from and aggrieved Liberal.<br><br>But what is also true is that, if we\u2019re going to strengthen democracy, if we want to encourage pluralism and civility and self-governance, we have to embrace and restore a language of mutual respect that speaks to peoples\u2019 need for belonging, that they care about the traditions they come from, they care about the places they come from. They want to feel proud about who they are. And that\u2019s easier to do in homogeneous countries; it\u2019s harder to do as countries become more diverse.<br><br>So my point is, a big part of strengthening democracy is not just about politics and policy; it is about culture. And we have to embrace that. We have to expand the civic education that we provide our children and give them practice to live in a democracy. We have to create organizations that give them experience in working with people who are different, and exercise their civic muscles. We need to create platforms that encourage a willingness that nudge people and incentivize people to extend good faith to those who are not like themselves, or don\u2019t think like themselves, a politics that is inclusive rather than exclusive. This is both ethically sound and a practical necessity, something that leaders Gandhi, and King, and Mandela understood. There\u2019s a reason why Nelson Mandela really focused on South African rugby, when he was released. He was sending a signal to those who had imprisoned him for 27 years, that I\u2019m not here to take away your traditions and your identity, as long as you make sure they are compatible with my dignity and respect for my people. (Applause.)<br><br>We need to find ways to build that kind of solidarity and forge connections with people, so that they don\u2019t push us away. That doesn\u2019t mean we have to indulge traditions that don\u2019t live up to our core principles of equality and human dignity, but it does mean that we need to use language that affirms the best of existing national, religious, and culture and ethnic traditions, rather than make arguments that make people feel like they have to abandon all aspects of their past. We can reckon with our darker histories without asking people to reject their own identities. Indeed, progress is about doing the work of perfecting our unions, not repudiating the possibility of a union.<br><br>Finally, as we do all these things, we have to take steps to detoxify our discourse, particularly the scourge of disinformation and conspiracy theories, and hate online that has polluted our political discourse.<br><br>Now, I spoke about at length about this at Stanford University, in the spring, but I\u2019ll just reinforce a few key points. Technology companies have to accept a degree of democratic oversight and accountability. Profit can\u2019t be the only driver for platforms who have acquired power once reserved for nation-states. And while no human endeavor can eliminate human fallibility, we can actually make these things better. These technologies and platforms were made by human beings; human beings can make them work better.<br><br>I look forward to doing more work in the months to come to lift up and put forth new ideas around technology and the other areas that I just mentioned, because these are the areas where we all have to do better. It\u2019s going to determine the fate of our democracies, whether they stick, whether they get stronger, or whether they continue to get weaker.<br><br>But, although I\u2019m ready to volunteer and sign up, and work with existing groups and organizations that are focused in these areas, I want to underscore\u200a\u2014\u200aI\u2019m probably not going to be the main driver of solutions at this stage, nor are many of us in this room, who already\u200a\u2014\u200aI won\u2019t say are passed our primes, but we have gone through\u200a\u2014\u200arun through positions of power. Because we need to build democracy for the future, not the past.<br><br>And what gives me hope is the promise and potential of the next generation of leaders who are coming up, young people who understand that the future of democracy, and in fact, the very planet that we live on, hangs in the balance. These young people are ready to do the work, and many of them are already deeply engaged in the project of rebuilding our democracies.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s who Michelle and I are supporting at our Foundation, and that is why I\u2019m so glad to be joined by just a small sampling of our extraordinary Obama Foundation leaders from all across Europe, who gathered here today. If you can all please welcome, Tudor, Federica and Selvije. Come on\u00a0up.</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/f1747082849d11f26f6f17f0643ac7ee/href\">https://medium.com/media/f1747082849d11f26f6f17f0643ac7ee/href</a><p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> First of all, you can tell what outstanding young leaders they are because they already know you want to bring your own fans to events. (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Before we start our conversation, I would love for each of you very briefly to describe for the audience who you are, what you\u2019ve been doing, and why it\u2019s been so exciting for you to gather with some of the other leaders and peers from across\u00a0Europe.</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI:</strong> First of all, thank you very much, Mr. President, for having us here and thanks to all the Obama leaders out there, because it\u2019s really nice getting an audience with you\u00a0guys.</p>\n<p>My name is Federica Vinci. I am the deputy mayor of Isernia, which is a small town in the south of Italy. The work that I do is basically to try to bring back politics, grassroots politics in a very small town in my region and hopefully, in the future, in my\u00a0country.</p>\n<p>The best part of being here with all these amazing leaders has been having the chance to reconnect with people that do our same job, even if different fields. Sometimes it feels lonely when you are on the ground trying to make change, but reconnecting with all of you has been such a gift, because it reminds us why we\u2019re here and what our purpose is. So thank you very\u00a0much.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> Excellent. (Applause.)</p>\n<p>Tudor?</p>\n<p><strong>TUDOR IULIAN BRADATAN:</strong> Thank you very much. I\u2019m Tudor. I\u2019m from Romania. I am the executive director of what we call an online digital campaigning organization. We work on multi-issues, ranging from the environment to the rule of law. We have an online community with 1.2 million members. This is the people that receive constantly our updates and are invited to take action whenever is needed. We put pressure on decision-makers each time there is a good opportunity.</p>\n<p>We fundraise from our members and this is how we manage to actually win campaigns. Sometimes we fundraise for expensive lawsuits. Sometimes we fundraise for ads in newspapers to get our message\u00a0across.</p>\n<p>I chose this work because it\u2019s my way of defending democracy and it\u2019s my way to help people, simple people from all walks of life to have a say in today\u2019s democracy basically.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> Excellent. (Applause.)</p>\n<p>Selvije?</p>\n<p><strong>SELVIJE MUSTAFI:</strong> Thank you so much. My name is Selvije Mustafi. I\u2019m coming from North Macedonia and I\u2019m national grassroots organizer within the biggest Roma national movement in Macedonia named Avaja, which means we are\u00a0coming.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been active for ten years now from the age of 16 and our movement\u2019s purpose is to build power in the communities and articulate Roma\u2019s issues on higher national\u00a0level.</p>\n<p>And another thing is now that from our movement, we also built another seven national movements in seven different countries, and I serve as trainer trying to build the communities, build the structures, and build\u00a0power.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> Fantastic. (Applause.)</p>\n<p>All right. So we only have about 40 minutes. I want to start with an open-ended question because in my opening remarks, I said that, certainly for my grandparents, my parents, and to some degree for me, when I think about democracy and the tension between democracy and authoritarianism, my reference point is the Cold War. I think about, you know, I was in law school when the Berlin Wall came down. I\u2019m trying to do the math as to whether you were born when the Berlin Wall came down. (Laughter.) I don\u2019t think so,\u00a0right?</p>\n<p>I\u2019m interested, when we\u2019re here at this democratic summit, how do you and your peers think about this issue of democracy in your own countries here in Europe, worldwide? Do you have a sense of concern and worry that democracy is declining? Do you feel cynical about how existing democracies operate?</p>\n<p>Obviously, it\u2019s hard to generalize for everybody your age, but you\u2019re also having a lot of conversations with people who are active and care about\u00a0issues.</p>\n<p>Federica, you want to\u00a0start?</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI:</strong> Being the deputy mayor of a small town, it means that I get to have a lot of meetings with people of my age, but also younger, 15 years old, 16, 18 years old, boys and girls. I remember right after that I was elected and nominated deputy mayor, I\u2019m also in charge of youth policies. Coming from a community organizing background, I decided to call all the representatives of the different high schools of my hometown. We sat around the table and I asked them, so guys, tell me, how have you worked with politicians in the past? What have you guys done together or what has been done for\u00a0you?</p>\n<p>And well, before asking this question, the first thing that they said to me was, have we done anything\u00a0wrong?</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> Why are you calling me in here? Am I in\u00a0trouble?</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI:</strong> Why are you calling us here? Are we in trouble? This made me realize that these guys and these girls had never been listened to\u00a0before.</p>\n<p>When we were talking about politics, they were completely disillusioned, not because\u200a\u2014\u200aand I thought because they didn\u2019t have any luck for the future or they didn\u2019t have any thought about their jobs. But actually they were not even thinking about their future. They had never been listened to. They had never been involved in policymaking. Politicians were doing policies without involving them at all. So they were like, we don\u2019t see politicians. We don\u2019t hear from them. We just see them when they want our\u00a0votes.</p>\n<p>And I think that if we want\u200a\u2014\u200aof course we want democracy, right? We want our rights to be protected. We want our freedom. I don\u2019t think that anybody would exchange democracy for anything in the world. Yet we have to admit that democracy, at least in places like mine, is failing generations, like my generation or generations even\u00a0younger.</p>\n<p>So we as politicians, as leaders have a huge responsibility to go back into these places and make these boys, these girls part of the solution, part of this policymaking process, listen to them and engage\u00a0them.</p>\n<p>Because we are talking about huge numbers. Like Italy has around 8,000 municipalities. 180 municipalities are above 50,000 people. All the rest, more than 7,800 municipalities are really small towns where politicians can have a day-to-day engagement with their constituencies and with those kids. I think it\u2019s our job to do it because this is the only way we can infuse hope in them and in the future of democracy.</p>\n<p>(Applause.)</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> As I listen, I\u2019m going to think of new questions, and I\u2019ll give you a new question, Tudor, but you can answer the old question. Take it where you want. But as I was listening to Federica speaking, she mentioned online. One thing we know about young people, whether in Europe, the United States, Africa, anywhere in the world, a larger portion of their time, attention is on the phone or a\u00a0screen.</p>\n<p>I know that you have worked in thinking about how to use these new technologies to engage people rather than isolate them. What strategies have worked for you when it comes to engaging people online? But how does that also then translate into action in the real world? Because we have an expression in the United States, \u201chashtag activism,\u201d where somebody just tweets like or has a sarcastic comment about something and then kind of feels like, well, there was my political activism for the day. (Laughter.) But it never actually translates into voting, mobilization, initiatives that bring about change. What\u2019s your\u00a0sense?</p>\n<p><strong>TUDOR IULIAN BRADATAN:</strong> I would rather answer with an example. In our world, we always say that e-mail is dead. It\u2019s difficult to reach people via e-mail. And it\u2019s a very good solution because unlike social media, the e-mail is targeted. You have an e-mail address, you send an e-mail, the person receives the e-mail. With social media, it\u2019s much more complicated than that. And with these new networks that arise, it\u2019s hard for us to even find ways in which we can actually tap in with our messaging.</p>\n<p>The example I\u2019m going to give you is with a petition that was started on our website by the students in Romania. They asked for a modernization of the way in which they\u2019re evaluated. They go through the same evaluation that I went through when I went to high school or my sister that is ten years older than me, and it wasn\u2019t\u00a0changed.</p>\n<p>What they did is they signed a petition on our website, 400,000 of them, almost every kid in school in Romania signed a petition. We require an e-mail when people signed that petition. They created that e-mail in order to sign the petition, and we want to work with them together for the next\u00a0steps.</p>\n<p>What happened with that petition? The first time that it was submitted to the Minister of Education, he kind of mocked them. But then they came up with follow-up tactics. The last declaration of the minister is somewhat, \u201cI\u2019m going to think about it,\u201d but already I see them win that campaign. Even if it\u2019s going to take a little bit more time, the way in which they work together, the way in which they are creative to put pressure on decision-makers makes me have much more hope than I have in my generation, for instance.</p>\n<p>I would not treat these kinds of things as individual, things that are too individualistic. We have to work together. The students in Romania, they somehow managed to find ways in which they talked. They used the platform that last time I heard of it, it was for online gaming, people synchronizing on strategies, and they used that software. It was impressive for me to see how well that can be organized and how efficient they are. That is the one thing that brings me a lot of\u00a0hope.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> Selvije, Federica works very local. And you, on the other hand, are part of a European-wide network advocating on behalf of the Roma people. What do you see, what are the trends that you\u2019re seeing in terms of young people getting involved Europe-wide and how do they feel about European democracy?</p>\n<p>Because one of the interesting things about democracy in Europe, I remember when I was president coming here, you had local governments, you had regional governments, you had national governments. Then you had Brussels. You\u2019ve got the EU. You\u2019ve got the European Parliament. There are a bunch of different ways to access politics. But I\u2019m wondering, does that make it more difficult or more accessible for people to want to get involved and to feel like they have a hand in who\u2019s making decisions that affect their\u00a0lives?</p>\n<p><strong>SELVIJE MUSTAFI:</strong> I\u2019m going to start with the following, that democracy has always meant the same. It has meant the voice of the people, the power of the people, the decision of the\u00a0people.</p>\n<p>And what I see in my generation and their perception and feeling of democracy has two aspects. The first one is that the Roma community, in their mid-twenties or even younger, they are very disappointed in democracy in general, also in the approach of how some political leaders are responding to democracy and democratic ideals.</p>\n<p>This has different reasons, because for so long, the Roma in general were excluded economically, politically, culturally, and were underrepresented. They didn\u2019t have their own representative who is coming directly from the community, who knows the issues in the community and the challenges, and who can deliver and articulate and try to solve them. Because representatives who are non-Roma, they cannot know what is happening in the Roma community better than the\u00a0Roma.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, working for ten years now in the community, building power in the community and showing different approaches, like relationship building and so on, the community and the young people see a different added value. They can participate in public dialogs with politicians, with different political actors, with mayors and so on, and they see that this is an element that gives them, how to say, that gives them a value where they can contribute.</p>\n<p>What is the narrative now in the community and among the youngsters? What I hear is, well, maybe we are, because we are the biggest ethnic minority in Europe with over 12 million Roma, maybe we are a key contributor to preserve democracy. And with all the painful, painful history and survivals that we had in the past, now we are still here and we are courageous and brave to take action. And that\u2019s what democracy is about, about bravery, an effort that will bring bigger\u00a0changes.</p>\n<p>(Cheers, applause.)</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> Excellent.</p>\n<p>All those people clapping up there, many of them are working on different issues. The three of you are working on different issues. One of the challenges for democracy in the United States is sometimes people become very narrow in the issues that they\u2019re concerned about. Climate change, that\u2019s a very complicated issue. Criminal justice reform is very detailed.</p>\n<p>Organizations, activists, even elected officials sometimes work narrowly, but in order to build power and actually move the levers of democracy, it\u2019s a huge advantage if you can form coalitions across\u00a0groups.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m wondering, how have you been thinking about in your own work or in conversations that you\u2019ve been having, the need to work across sectors or how do you think about the relationship between working in non-profits versus running for office? Always a difficult debate, I think, does change come more from the inside or from the outside, beating down the door? How have you been thinking about\u00a0that?</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI:</strong> We were just laughing because we were having this discussion 15 minutes\u00a0ago.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> Were you encouraging Tudor to run for something?</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI:</strong> Exactly, run for office,\u00a0yes.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> He\u2019s a very handsome guy. I think he could do\u00a0well.</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI:</strong> I\u2019m trying. I\u2019m trying really hard. But it\u2019s like he wants to be convinced.</p>\n<p>What I believe is that we need way more cross-sectional politics in general, but way more engagement in different sectors. Yes, there are tons of challenges. First of all, generally, as we were saying, activists do not want to run for office. This is what I\u2019m trying to change from the very bottom, because I believe that we have generally attached a very negative meaning to politics.</p>\n<p>While politics is the air we breathe, politics is in every single thing we do. It\u2019s in the transportations that we take, it\u2019s in the climate, it\u2019s in the way we engage with people, it\u2019s in the way we speak, how we are educated; politics is everything. So whenever someone tells me, \u201cOh, politics is bad, politics is corrupted, politics is full of scandals,\u201d I reply, \u201cThis is what governs your life.\u201d If this is what governs your life, do you really want to be governed by the worst people that you think are getting there? And we are electing them in democracies.</p>\n<p>So what I don\u2019t understand and what we were discussing about is that we talk a lot about democracy, but then especially in countries like mine, in places like mine, we have the lowest standards for the people that then get up in the parliament and write these laws for\u00a0us.</p>\n<p>I think that if we really want to change things, we need more people that have super-high moral standards and that want to change things from the grassroots to the top level to get engaged into politics and get elected. Because it\u2019s true that you can get an amazing amount of change as an activist.</p>\n<p>I was an activist before becoming a politician. I was a community organizer.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> Me, too. (Laughter, applause.)</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI:</strong> And I think I still want to be an activist. I want to be an activist. I want to get out and rally for climate change or I want to get out with my people and clean parks, if we need\u00a0to.</p>\n<p>But we cannot avoid thinking that politics is not part of the game. Politics is part of the game. Politics will always be part of the game. And if we don\u2019t think that we don\u2019t have to get engaged, then we will keep being governed by the people that we don\u2019t like, even though we vote for them. And then we have voter apathy and we have kids not going to vote and we have people getting way, way far away from politics, while this still governs our\u00a0life.</p>\n<p>This has to change and I am arguing that this needs to change from the very bottom where people like me, politicians, can start talking face to face with their constituency and regaining the trust that they\u2019ve lost so far because they have been governed by the wrong people, because the right one were just too scared of the bad environment that politics brings up\u00a0on.</p>\n<p>(Cheers, applause.)</p>\n<p><strong>TUDOR IULIAN BRADATAN:</strong> Almost convinced me, but no. I have resistance still.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> I\u2019m not going to put you on the spot today and ask you to announce your candidacy, but this goes to the issues of this summit. It\u2019s often easy to defend democracy in the abstract. But if you have been an activist and you\u2019ve been working from the outside, sometimes it is difficult to see why change is moving so slowly on the inside. As I said in my remarks, some of that is by\u00a0design.</p>\n<p>As somebody who started locally and then ended up running a pretty big government, a lot of the activists who worked with me would get frustrated and think somehow that, well, how come he hasn\u2019t gotten this done or that done yet? It must be because he no longer cares about us. He\u2019s talking to all these rich contributors and this and that. When, in fact, no, I still want exactly what you wanted, but the wheels of government are just moving very slowly because there are all these systems that are set up to block\u00a0it.</p>\n<p>The reason I say that is because I think for democracy to work, you have to have both. You have to have people who are in the engine room and the deck of the ship of democracy, working to make it move in the right direction, but you also have to have people on the outside who are constantly maintaining pressure and getting people involved, because that\u2019s the engine, that\u2019s the fuel that ultimately is going to get you to where you want to\u00a0go.</p>\n<p>And so, I\u2019m interested in how\u200a\u2014\u200aas I said, Tudor, you don\u2019t have to announce your candidacy.</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI:</strong> Not\u00a0yet.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> Because there is an important role to play in citizen participation, activism, organization. And so far, that\u2019s the role you\u2019ve chosen to play. Do you feel like you can make enough of a difference taking that approach, particularly if maybe sometimes you see\u200a\u2014\u200ayou said like the education minister seemed like he\u2019s not listening to 400,000 students. Do you think, \u201cyou know what, we should have somebody in there who does\u00a0listen?\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>TUDOR IULIAN BRADATAN:</strong> It\u2019s a big temptation for many activists to go into politics, and I admire those who do. It\u2019s not a matter of me thinking that politics is dirty and we should not touch it. No, politics is where decisions are\u00a0made.</p>\n<p>My fear is that, if people like me enter politics, we leave an empty spot in the civil society, and that supporting a country like Romania was difficult to fill in the first place. We are a young democracy. If all of us from the civil society turn into politics, we need to bring new people to form this new civil society. What I noticed in my line of work is that politicians become better when we demand them to do\u00a0so.</p>\n<p>Now, I think that in a way, the civil society is like that bad medicine that tastes bad, but you still need to take it because it makes you healthy. I like to be that medicine that tastes bad. It makes me feel better. (Laughter, applause.) But if I would get one single dollar each time I\u2019m invited to join politics, I would solve the funding for my organization for ten years. (Laughter.)</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> Let me start with you on this question, Selvije. We talked about online organizing, but one of the things that I do think has changed, even since I was in office, was the amount of misinformation, the difficulty of sorting between what\u2019s true and what\u2019s false, what\u2019s journalism and what\u2019s fabrication.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m wondering how all of you in the work that you try to do have dealt with the misinformation problem, whether it affects your work and whether you\u2019ve come up with some solutions, so that you can get facts and information out to people and you don\u2019t have to spend all your time refuting things that people think that aren\u2019t true, and in some cases politicize issues that shouldn\u2019t be political.</p>\n<p>In the United States, as I think many of you saw, COVID became somehow a political issue and getting vaccinated or wearing masks. A lot of that was driven just by misinformation that was out there, and that seems to be happening on more and more issues. I\u2019m wondering how it\u2019s affected you and whether you\u2019ve seen some solutions to help young people distinguish between what\u2019s true and false in making decisions about how to participate and what to\u00a0support.</p>\n<p><strong>SELVIJE MUSTAFI:</strong> Yes, definitely digital, the digital space has fundamentally altered on how people are being exposed to engage with information. And I think that the internet has enabled a lot of people to create and expand different kinds of content by a large audience at marginal costs, and it\u2019s instantly and freely accessible.</p>\n<p>However, there are big concerns also in our movement about how false information and misinformation is spreading on the internet to influence decisions by some political actors or political sides. So using the social media, you can create, and you can expand different kinds of misinformation.</p>\n<p>And as you said, the challenge is that those kind of fake news and misinformation are making the people to have a different kind of opinion, which is not necessarily relevant or truthful. And this is an issue we have also with the Roma community, a community who has been discriminated for so long, ignored. It\u2019s very easy. There is a big base to spread fake news and to make them think like that, and not necessarily they can now differentiate what is opinion and what is\u00a0fact.</p>\n<p>So what we do as activists, as movements, and\u200a\u2014\u200aI mean, what we what we can\u2019t do is we cannot\u200a\u2014\u200awe don\u2019t have the space and tools how to regulate the internet, but what we can do is to try to counteract this kind of false news and to try to actively produce content that is relevant and spread the frequency of our own message and our own narrative.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA: </strong>Excellent. Frederica, as an elected officials and activist, is that a problem that you\u2019ve seen in terms of the work that you\u2019re doing? Do you find you make a proposal, and somebody says, \u201cWell, you know, I just saw on the internet that what you\u2019re doing is going to cause cancer,\u201d or it\u2019s going to, you know, destroy the economy or something? And then you have to spend a lot of time unwinding some of\u00a0this?</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI: </strong>Yeah, and exactly, words like this. I really\u200a\u2014\u200alike a simple example, the cost of energy and the cost of water, they rose because of the war, yet we had a couple of newspapers saying that, since\u200a\u2014\u200athat we were getting paid by the taxpayer money of this increase in water and\u00a0energy.</p>\n<p>So it obviously is false, and it obviously should be easier to think about it, because it\u2019s like the war, and it\u2019s something way above us. Yet, what comes out there, and even what I notice is that it\u2019s even easier for people to get out this false news and this false noise, and it\u2019s\u00a0scary.</p>\n<p>So, and it\u2019s not just about that. It\u2019s about rumors that get out. It\u2019s about voices, rumors, like people talking to people. So in a very small town, you have a huge amount of rumors coming out, and our question was like, how do we counteract against it? What do we\u00a0do?</p>\n<p>So of course you can work online, but in such a small town, and again, Italy is full, and I guess also Europe, it\u2019s full of such small places. You can have a real confrontation with your constituencies.</p>\n<p>So we\u2019ve started having town halls in like open-air tunnels, and now that it\u2019s summer and COVID is not such a big risk, especially outside. And we\u2019ve asked people to join us in sharing with us their fears, their questions, what they want, how can we answer to their problems?</p>\n<p>And the first time, nobody asked questions. It was really weird, but then\u00a0\u2013</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA: </strong>Everybody just sat there for half-an-hour?</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI: </strong>Yeah, exactly, so we started talking about our policies, but then\u200a\u2014\u200ayeah, but then, on our policies, they started asking questions. And many of the were really good questions. We see a lot of anger on Facebook, a lot of anger on social media. And when you go in real life, first of all, this anger is not that bad, but second, it has a motive. It has a\u00a0reason.</p>\n<p>And when you meet your people and you can ask them, you can listen to them, you actually know what those reasons are, and you can give them answers. And not only, I think we should give them answers, but I think we should include them in the decision-making process and the implementation of the policies that we bring\u00a0about.</p>\n<p>So to counteract this fake news environment in the small town, I guess that the real solution is coming back on the ground, the grassroots, meeting with people, answering their questions, involving them and making them part of the changes that we want to see\u00a0around.</p>\n<p>(Applause.)</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA: </strong>Excellent. So we\u2019re coming to the end of our session here, and I want to give you a two-part question. If you ever decide to run for office, this is how reporters get around it. They\u2019re only supposed to get one question, that is, \u201cSir, I have a five-part question,\u201d and then they go and tick them off, and so I\u2019m going to use the trick they taught me. And you can answer both, either one, or just don\u2019t answer, which is also a strategy that I taught them. (Laughter.) And talk about what I want to talk\u00a0about.</p>\n<p>I opened with my remarks, and obviously an enormous amount of time has been spent at this summit, talking about the tragedy of what\u2019s happening in Ukraine. And I\u2019m wondering how you think this has affected you, your generation, to witness this kind of crisis in the heart of Europe in a way that harkens back to your grandparents\u2019 generation. It\u2019s been a long time since we saw that much violence, and now we can witness in real time and displacement. So I\u2019m curious how has it impacted you and your friends? How do you talk about it? And does it encourage you to see the response and make you more committed to the public work that you\u2019re doing? So that\u2019s one question.</p>\n<p>Part two, because we\u2019re running out of time, is what are the things that do inspire you and keep you going? Because I think, whether it\u2019s you Frederica or Tudor, but I know you all feel it, sometimes the work gets lonely. And sometimes democracy is discouraging. What is it that has kept that optimism and hope going even when you confront setbacks and when you feel like democracy\u2019s not working? So why don\u2019t we start then with\u00a0you.</p>\n<p><strong>SELVIJE MUSTAFI: </strong>Well, I think that the recent context and situation has affected generally the youth and in particular in the Roma community in many aspects, in many ways, psychologically, financially. And there is a lot of frustration.</p>\n<p>And as a matter of fact, in Ukraine, there are a lot of Roma. There is a big Roma community who has also been put aside and discriminated for so long. But yet again, the Roma who are there are fighting for Ukraine, and they are fighting for\u00a0freedom.</p>\n<p>So I hope the war ends as soon as possible. And I hope that after the war, Roma won\u2019t be forgotten.</p>\n<p>What really inspires me, because for so long the narrative towards us was negative. Many, much of stigma, negative perception, and big part of the Roma community accepted that. But going into the community, talking to people, working with people, and seeing how much of a big potential the Roma are, and how much of a big capacity we have, this is what really inspires me and drives\u00a0me.</p>\n<p>And this is something that I felt from the very beginning of my activism, 10 years ago, and I still feel it whenever I go to the community. And I think that this is the new generation of a driving change. And a community who can preserve democracy and who can be part of preserving democracy in the next period, and I hope, I really hope that Europe, European stakeholders and institutions will have more openness towards Roma and more inclusiveness in particular.</p>\n<p>(Applause.)</p>\n<p><strong>TUDOR IULIAN BRADATAN: </strong>When you asked me about\u200a\u2014\u200alike, how do I see democracy now, it made me realize that I\u2019m\u200a\u2014\u200ain my family, I\u2019m the first generation that lived their young years in peace and democracy. My parents, they lived theirs in the Cold War. My grandparents fought in World War II. My great-grandparents fought in World War\u00a0I.</p>\n<p>And so I am the first one, basically, that lived to see democracy. Now, I\u2019m not that young. I have gray hair. I still can hide it underneath the other parts. And I still remember the days in Romania when we were a dictatorship. I was very young, but there are things that still are very strong memories, the queues to go and buy food, the heaters that were cold in the\u00a0winter.</p>\n<p>I do not want to go back that. And for many years I thought that, for instance, war is something that is unthinkable, and after 2014, it became obvious that war is again a thing in Europe. And it scares me. And that\u2019s the reality. But that\u2019s what\u200a\u2014\u200aI mean, when we get paralyzed with fear, that\u2019s when they win. Fear is not really an option for us, because I do not want to go back to the days when Romania was a dictatorship. I do not want to see those atrocities happen\u00a0again.</p>\n<p>So I will fight with everything I have to keep the democracy going and make sure that this system, as imperfect as it is, keeps on going because it is the only thing that allows me to be in places like this to meet the amazing leaders that I met in the last few days. And meeting you is something that would have been unthinkable for my parents\u2019 generation.</p>\n<p>So we have to defend this because what would come next is unimaginable.</p>\n<p>(Applause.)</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA: </strong>Madam Mayor, you get the last word\u00a0here.</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI: </strong>When it comes to Ukraine, I still remember the day of the war, and I remember calling my friends in\u200a\u2014\u200aI mean, we were all shocked, and it was something that lasted for a while. Like we had that punch in the stomach. We couldn\u2019t think about what was happening. We couldn\u2019t think about the fact that we were\u200a\u2014\u200alike that our borders, like Ukraine, which we consider Europe, were at\u00a0war.</p>\n<p>And we are like a really big European generation, and so we felt extremely attacked, sad, lost, somehow. But on the other hand, it was also sort of a wake-up call, a reminder that, in Italy, at least in my town, and in my region, we are still lucky enough to be able to keep working on our democracy, that it\u2019s not working as we would like it to be. It\u2019s not being like we would like it to\u00a0be.</p>\n<p>So that, that brings me to the point of what is it that is passionate for me, and moves me, especially when you live in a town where, in front of you, you don\u2019t have just your political opponent, but probably the woman who stole your boyfriend when you were 15 years old and you still haven\u2019t forgotten.</p>\n<p>(Laughter.)</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA: </strong>That\u2019s a good point. I mean, that\u2019s\u200a\u2014\u200aif it\u2019s, you know, that makes it a little more personal.</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI:\u00a0</strong>Exactly.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA: </strong>You\u2019re, no\u200a\u2014\u200aI wasn\u2019t pointing. She\u2019s not here. I was pretending that I was pointing (laughter).</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI: </strong>But it gets harder because you want to do stuff, and you know that you can\u2019t move on because probably there is something personal behind it. So how do you do it? And this is also what gave me\u00a0hope.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll tell you, like a short story. I have been working with this woman\u200a\u2014\u200anot working, but I would have loved to have worked with this woman, but since I\u2019ve gotten elected, she\u2019s been opposing every single thing that I try to propose, from the football court for the kids, from a youth center, and with no reason, I couldn\u2019t understand why.</p>\n<p>So one day I went into the local high school to talk to the youth of the local high school, and I was talking to them about the fact that my mom wanted me to become a lawyer. My dad wanted me to become a consultant. I tried both, I hated them both. And then I got into politics, which was my\u00a0dream.</p>\n<p>And I told these kids that we live in a society that doesn\u2019t give us the space to understand who we are, what we love, and what we want to do. So it\u2019s their job and our job as politicians to support them in finding the space and allowing them to become what they\u00a0want.</p>\n<p>Great speech. I went back home, slept on it. The morning after, I receive a call. It was this woman, and she said, \u201cLook, my daughter was on the stage and was listening to you, and she filmed you, and she sent me the recording. And I wanted to thank you because my story is your story with the difference that I didn\u2019t have the courage that you had to follow my own dreams. And having you out there talking to my daughter about the fact that you did gave my daughter the confidence to come to me and say that she wanted to become an architect. So thank you very much. I\u2019m looking forward to work with you on this youth\u00a0center.\u201d</p>\n<p>(Applause.)</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA: </strong>That\u2019s\u00a0great.</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI: </strong>Knowing that, beyond being politicians, we are human beings that share stories, and at the end of the day, we all want this world to be a better place, that\u2019s what gives me hope, because I see, every single day, that we can overcome our differences. We can build bridges. We can close the gap between the politicians, the high school girls that had a fight over a boyfriend. And we can unite on what really matters for us. And this gives me a lot of\u00a0hope.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA: </strong>Good. Well, you\u200a\u2014\u200athe three of you give me hope. The young people who are working with us at the Foundation are giving us hope. For those of you who are already parts of organizations working on democratic issues, either here or on other continents, I cannot tell you enough that we have to invest in this cohort if we are going to succeed. Because every time I have a chance to have conversations, the kind of idealism and innovation and imagination and courage that you\u2019ve heard from these three, they\u2019re out there. And they need to be heard, and they need to be empowered, because they\u2019re going to be the ones who take us where we need to\u00a0go.</p>\n<p>All right. Please give them a big round of applause. Thank you, everybody. Thank\u00a0you.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=e9740dc78c5a\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n","enclosure":{},"categories":[]},{"title":"Announcing the Voyager Scholarship for Students with a Passion for Public Service","pubDate":"2022-05-16 13:18:03","link":"https://barackobama.medium.com/announcing-the-voyager-scholarship-for-students-with-a-passion-for-public-service-d2ce85607087?source=rss-9e422a605dc5------2","guid":"https://medium.com/p/d2ce85607087","author":"Barack Obama","thumbnail":"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*yI-8k7ZbfiaNaQuImhK4RA.jpeg","description":"\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*yI-8k7ZbfiaNaQuImhK4RA.jpeg\"></figure><p>In an increasingly globalized world, forging connections is more important than ever.

It is great to be in California and back in beautiful Palo Alto. Coming here always makes me want to go back to college, although an 18-year-old Barack Obama would not have gotten in. I got more serious,\u00a0later.</p>\n<p>I want to thank the Cyber Policy Center here at Stanford for hosting this event. I want to thank Tiana for that outstanding introduction, and for all the work that you are doing. I want to thank a great friend and a remarkable public servant and Ambassador of Russia, during very difficult times, and one of my top advisors, Michael McFaul, for being\u00a0here.</p>\n<p>Michelle and I set up the Obama Foundation to train the next generation of leaders, and I think you saw in Tiana, the example of the kind of remarkable leadership that\u2019s out there, with the talent and vision to lead us forward, as long as old people get out of the\u00a0way.</p>\n<p>During some of the darkest days of World War II, American philosopher, Reinhold Niebuhr, wrote the following, \u201cMan\u2019s capacity for justice makes democracy possible, but man\u2019s inclination to injustice makes democracy necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p>We\u2019re living through another tumultuous, dangerous moment in history. All of us have been horrified by Russia\u2019s brutal invasion of the Ukraine. A nuclear-armed despot\u2019s response to a neighboring state whose only provocation is its desire to be independent and democratic. An invasion of this scale hasn\u2019t been seen in Europe since World War II, and we\u2019ve all witnessed the resulting death and destruction, and the displacement, in real\u00a0time.</p>\n<p>The stakes are enormous, and the courage displayed by ordinary Ukrainians has been extraordinary and demands our support. Unfortunately, a war in the Ukraine isn\u2019t happening in a vacuum. Vladimir Putin\u2019s aggression is part of a larger trend, even if similar levels of oppression and lawless and violence and suffering don\u2019t always attract the same levels of attention if they happen outside of\u00a0Europe,</p>\n<p>Autocrats and aspiring strongmen have become emboldened around the globe. They\u2019re actively subverting democracy, they\u2019re undermining hard-won human rights, they\u2019re ignoring international law.</p>\n<p>Democratic backsliding is not restricted to distant lands. Right here, in the United States of America, we just saw a sitting president deny the clear results of an election and help incite a violent insurrection at the nation\u2019s capital. Not only that, but a majority of his party, including many who occupy some of the highest offices in the land, continue to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the last election, and are using it to justify laws that restrict the vote, making it easier to overturn the will of the people in states where they hold\u00a0power.</p>\n<p>But for those of us who believe in democracy and the rule of law, this should serve as a wake-up call. We have to admit that, at least in the years since the Cold War ended, democracies have grown dangerously complacent.</p>\n<p>Too often, we\u2019ve taken freedom for granted. What recent events remind us, is that democracy is neither inevitable nor self-executed. Citizens like us have to nurture it. We have to tend to it and fight for it, and as our circumstances change, we have to be willing to look at ourselves critically, making reforms that can allow democracy, not just to survive, but to\u00a0thrive.</p>\n<p>That won\u2019t be easy. A lot of factors have contributed to the weakening of democratic institutions around the world. One of those factors is globalization which has helped lift hundreds and millions out of poverty, most notably in China and India, but which, along with automation has also ended entire economies, accelerated global inequality, and left millions of others feeling betrayed and angry at existing political institutions.</p>\n<p>There is the increased mobility and urbanization of modern life, which further shakes up societies, including existing family structures and gender roles. Here at home, we\u2019ve seen a steady decline in the number of people participating in unions, civic organizations and houses of worship, mediating institutions that once served as a kind of communal\u00a0glue.</p>\n<p>Internationally, the rise of China as well as chronic political dysfunction, here in the U.S. and in Europe, not to mention the near collapse of the global financial system in 2008, has made it easier for leaders in other countries to discount democracy\u2019s appeal. And as once marginalized groups demand a seat at the table, politicians have found a new audience for old-fashioned appeals to racial and ethnic, religious or national solidarity.</p>\n<p>In the rush to protect us from them, virtues like tolerance and respect for democratic processes start to look, not just expendable, but like a threat to our way of\u00a0life.</p>\n<p>So if we\u2019re going to strengthen democracy, we\u2019ll have to address all of these strengths. We\u2019ll have to come up with new models for a more inclusive, equitable capitalism. We\u2019ll have to reform our political institutions in ways that allow people to be heard and give them real agency. We\u2019ll have to tell better stories about ourselves and how we can live together, despite our differences.</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s why I\u2019m here today, on Stanford\u2019s campus, in the heart of Silicon Valley, where so much of the digital, because I\u2019m convinced that right now one of the biggest impediments to doing all of this, indeed, of the biggest reasons for democracies weakening is the profound change that\u2019s taking place in how we communicate and consume information.</p>\n<p>Now let me start off by saying I am not a Luddite, although it is true that sometimes I have to ask my daughters how to work basic functions on my phone. I am amazed by the internet. It\u2019s connected billions of people around the world, put the collected knowledge of centuries at our fingertips. It\u2019s made our economies vastly more efficient, accelerated medical advances, opened up new opportunities, allowed people with shared interests to find each\u00a0other.</p>\n<p>I might never have been elected president if it hadn\u2019t been for websites like, and I\u2019m dating myself, MySpace, MeetUp and Facebook who allowed an army of young volunteers to organize, raise money, spread our message. That\u2019s what elected\u00a0me.</p>\n<p>And since then, we\u2019ve all witnessed the ways that activists use social media platforms to register dissent and shine a light on injustice and mobilize people on issues like climate change and racial\u00a0justice.</p>\n<p>So the internet and the accompanying information revolution has been transformative. And there\u2019s no turning back. But like all advances in technology, this progress has had unintended consequences that sometimes come at a price. And in this case, we see that our new information ecosystem is turbocharging some of humanity\u2019s worst impulses.</p>\n<p>Not all of these effects are intentional or even avoidable. They\u2019re simply the consequence of billions of humans suddenly plugged in one instant 24/7 global information stream. Forty years ago, if you were a conservative in rural Texas, you weren\u2019t necessarily offended by what was going on in San Francisco\u2019s Castro District because you didn\u2019t know what was going\u00a0on.</p>\n<p>If you lived in an impoverished Yemeni village, you had no insight into the spending habits of the Kardashians. For some such exposure may be eye opening, perhaps even liberating, but others may experience that exposure as a direct affront to their traditions, their belief systems, their place in society. Then you have the sheer proliferation of content and the splintering of information and audiences. That\u2019s made democracy more complicated.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll date myself again. If you were watching TV here in the United States between about 1960 and 1990, <em>I Dream of Jeannie</em>, <em>The Jeffersons</em>. Chances are you were watching one of the big three networks. And this had its own problems, particularly the ways in which programing often excluded voices and perspectives of women and people of color and other folks outside of the mainstream. But it did fortify a sense of shared culture and it came to the news, at least, citizens across the political spectrum tended to operate using a shared set of facts, what they saw, what they heard from Walter Cronkite or David Brinkley or\u00a0others.</p>\n<p>Today, of course, we occupy entirely different media realities, fed directly into our phones. You don\u2019t even have to look up. And it\u2019s made all of us more prone to what psychologists call confirmation bias, the tendency to select facts and opinions that reinforce our preexisting worldviews and filter out those that\u00a0don\u2019t.</p>\n<p>So inside our personal information bubbles, our assumptions, our blind spots, our prejudices aren\u2019t challenged, they\u2019re reinforced. And naturally we\u2019re more likely to react negatively to those consuming different facts and opinions. All of which deepens existing racial and religious and cultural\u00a0divides.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s fair to say then that some of the current challenges we face are inherent to a fully connected world. Our brains aren\u2019t accustomed to taking in this much information this fast, and a lot of us are experiencing overload. But not all problems we\u2019re seeing now are a byproduct of this new technology. They\u2019re also the result of very specific choices made by the companies that have come to dominate the internet generally and social media platforms in particular. Decisions that, intentionally or not, have made democracies more vulnerable.</p>\n<p>Now I\u2019m at Stanford. Most of you know the story by now. Twenty years ago, pillars of web search were comprehensiveness, relevance and speed. But with the rise of social media and the need to better understand people\u2019s online behavior, in order to sell more advertising, companies want to collect more data. More companies optimized for personalization, engagement and speed. And unfortunately, it turns out that inflammatory, polarizing content attracts and\u00a0engages.</p>\n<p>Other features of these platforms have compounded the problem. For example, the way content looks on your phone, as well as the veil of anonymity that platforms provide their users. A lot of times this makes it impossible to tell the difference between, say, a peer-reviewed article by Dr. Anthony Fauci and a miracle cure being pitched by a huckster.</p>\n<p>And meanwhile, sophisticated actors from political consultants to commercial interests, to intelligence arms of foreign powers can game platform algorithms or artificially boost the reach of the deceptive or harmful messages.</p>\n<p>Of course, this business model has proven to be wildly successful. For more and more of us, search and social media platforms aren\u2019t just our window into the internet; they serve as our primary source of news and information.</p>\n<p>No one tells us that the window is blurred, subject to unseen distortions and subtle manipulations. All we see is a constant feed of content where useful factual information and happy diversions, and cat videos, flow alongside lies, conspiracy theories, junk science, quackery, White supremacist, racist tracts, misogynist screeds. And over time, we lose our capacity to distinguish between fact, opinion and wholesale fiction. Or maybe we just stop\u00a0caring.</p>\n<p>And all of us, including our children, learn that if you want to rise above the crowd, above the din, if you want to be liked and shared, and yes, go viral! Then peddling controversy, outrage, even hate often gives you an\u00a0edge.</p>\n<p>Now it\u2019s true, tech companies and social media platforms are not the only distributors of toxic information. I promise you; I spend a lot of time in Washington, right?</p>\n<p>In fact, some of the most outrageous content on the Web originates from traditional media. What social media platforms have done, though, thanks to their increasing market dominance and their emphasis on speed, is accelerate the decline of newspapers and other traditional news\u00a0sources.</p>\n<p>There are still brand name newspapers and magazines, not to mention network news broadcasts, NPR other outlets that have adapted to the new digital environment while maintaining the highest standards of journalistic integrity. But as more and more ad revenue flows to the platforms that disseminate the news, rather than that money going to the newsrooms that report it, publishers, reporters, editors, they all feel the pressure to maximize engagement in order to\u00a0compete.</p>\n<p>Reporters start worrying about, \u201cI gotta tweet something, cause if I don\u2019t, I may be out of a job.\u201d That\u2019s the information environment we now live in. It\u2019s not just that these platforms have\u200a\u2014\u200aand there are exceptions\u200a\u2014\u200abeen largely agnostic regarding the kind of information available and connections made on their sites. It\u2019s that in the competition between truth and falsehood, cooperation and conflict, the very design of these platforms seems to be tilting us in the wrong direction.</p>\n<p>And we\u2019re seeing the results take over. The fact that scientists developed safe, effective vaccines in record time is an unbelievable achievement. And yet despite the fact that we\u2019ve now, essentially clinically tested the vaccine on billions of people worldwide, around 1 in 5 Americans is still willing to put themselves at risk and put their families at risk rather than get vaccinated. People are dying because of misinformation.</p>\n<p>I already mentioned the 2020 presidential election. President Trump\u2019s own attorney general has said that the Justice Department uncovered no evidence of widespread voter fraud. A review of the ballots in Arizona\u2019s largest county, the results of which were endorsed by some pretty courageous local Republicans, because many of them were harassed and received death threats, actually more votes for President Biden and fewer votes for President Trump. And yet today, as we speak, a majority of Republicans still insist that President Biden\u2019s victory was not legitimate. That\u2019s a lot of\u00a0people.</p>\n<p>In Myanmar, it\u2019s been well-documented that hate speech shared on Facebook played a role in the murderous campaign targeting the Rohingya community. Social media platforms have been similarly implicated in fanning ethnic violence in Ethiopia, far-right extremism in\u00a0Europe.</p>\n<p>Authoritarian regimes and strongmen around the world from China to Hungary, the Philippines. Brazil have learned to conscript social media platforms to turn their own populations against groups they don\u2019t like, whether it\u2019s ethnic minorities, the LGBTQ community, journalists, political opponents. And of course, autocrats like Putin have used these platforms as a strategic weapon against democratic countries that they consider a\u00a0threat.</p>\n<p>People like Putin and Steve Bannon, for that matter, understand it\u2019s not necessary for people to believe this information in order to weaken democratic institutions. You just have to flood a country\u2019s public square with enough raw sewage. You just have to raise enough questions, spread enough dirt, plant enough conspiracy theorizing that citizens no longer know what to\u00a0believe.</p>\n<p>Once they lose trust in their leaders, in mainstream media, in political institutions, in each other, in the possibility of truth, the game\u2019s won. And as Putin discovered leading up to the 2016 election, our own social media platforms are well designed to support such a mission, such a\u00a0project.</p>\n<p>Russians could study and manipulate patterns in the engagement ranking system on a Facebook or YouTube. And as a result, Russian\u2019s state sponsor trolls could almost guarantee that whatever disinformation they put out there would reach millions of Americans. And that the more inflammatory the story, the quicker it\u00a0spread.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been writing my memoirs lately, including reflections on events leading up to that election. The regrets I have, the things I might have missed. No one in my administration was surprised that Russia was attempting to meddle in our election. They had been doing that for years. Or that it was using social media in these\u00a0efforts.</p>\n<p>Before the election, I directed our top intelligence officials to expose those efforts to the press and to the public. What does still nag at me, though? Was my failure to fully appreciate at the time just how susceptible we had become to lies and conspiracy theories, despite having spent years being a target of disinformation myself.</p>\n<p>Putin didn\u2019t do that. He didn\u2019t have to. We did it to ourselves.</p>\n<p>So where do we go from\u00a0here?</p>\n<p>If we do nothing, I am convinced the trends that we\u2019re seeing will get worse. New technologies are already challenging the way we regulate currency, how we keep consumers safe from fraud. And with the emergence of AI, disinformation will grow more sophisticated. I\u2019ve already seen demonstrations of deepfake technology that show what looks like me on a screen saying stuff I did not say. It\u2019s a strange experience, people.</p>\n<p>Without some standards, implications of this technology, for our elections, for our legal system, for our democracy, for rules of evidence, for our entire social order are frightening and profound.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, I am convinced that it is possible to preserve the transformative power and promise of the open internet, while at least mitigating the worst of its harms. And I believe that those of you in the tech community, soon to be in the tech community, not just its corporate leaders, but employees at every level have to be part of the solution.</p>\n<p>The essence of this place, what put Silicon Valley on the map is a spirit of innovation. That\u2019s what led to the globally integrated internet, and all its remarkable applications. What we\u2019ve now learned is the product has some design flaws. There are some bugs in the software. We don\u2019t have to just leave it like that. Through the same spirit of innovation. We can make it\u00a0better.</p>\n<p>So I want to make some general suggestions for what that work might look like. But before I do, let me offer a few stipulations so we don\u2019t get bogged down in some well-worn, not always productive arguments.</p>\n<p>Number one, media companies, tech companies, social media platforms did not create the divisions in our society, here or in other parts of the world. Social media did not create racism or white supremacist groups. It didn\u2019t create the kind of ethno-nationalism that. Putin\u2019s enraptured with. It didn\u2019t create sexism, class conflict, religious strife, greed, envy, all the deadly sins. All these things existed long before the first tweet or Facebook\u00a0poke.</p>\n<p>Solving the disinformation problem won\u2019t cure all that ails our democracies or tears at the fabric of our world, but it can help tamp down divisions and let us rebuild the trust and solidarity needed to make our democracy stronger. And to take on anti-women mentalities, and deal with racism in our society, and build bridges between people. It can do\u00a0that.</p>\n<p>Second, we aren\u2019t going to get rid of all offensive or inflammatory content on the web. That is a strawman. We\u2019d be wrong to try. Freedom of speech is at the heart of every democratic society in America those protections are enshrined in the First Amendment to our Constitution. There\u2019s a reason it came first in the Bill of\u00a0Rights.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m pretty close to a First Amendment absolutist. I believe that in most instances the answer to bad speech is good speech. I believe that the free, robust, sometimes antagonistic exchange of ideas produces better outcomes and a healthier society.</p>\n<p>No Democratic government can or should do what China, for example, is doing, simply telling people what they can and cannot say or publish while trying to control what others say about their country abroad. And I don\u2019t have a lot of confidence that any single individual or organization, private or public, should be charged or do a good job at determining who gets to hear\u00a0what.</p>\n<p>That said, the First Amendment is a check on the power of the state. It doesn\u2019t apply to private companies like Facebook or Twitter, any more than it applies to editorial decisions made by <em>The New York Times </em>or Fox News. It never has. Social media companies already make choices about what is or is not allowed on their platforms and how that content appears, both explicitly through content, moderation, and implicitly through algorithms.</p>\n<p>The problem is, we often don\u2019t know what principles govern those decisions. And on an issue of enormous public interest, there has been little public debate and practically no democratic oversight.</p>\n<p>Three, any rules we come up with to govern the distribution of content on the Internet will involve value judgments. None of us are perfectly objective. What we consider unshakeable truth today may prove to be totally wrong tomorrow. But that doesn\u2019t mean some things aren\u2019t truer than others or that we can\u2019t draw lines between opinions, facts, honest mistakes, intentional deceptions.</p>\n<p>We make these distinctions all the time in our daily lives, at work, in school, at home, in sports, and we can do the same when it comes to Internet content, as long as we agree on a set of principles, some core values to guide the work. So, in the interest of full transparency, here\u2019s what I think our guiding principles should\u00a0be.</p>\n<p>The way I\u2019m going to evaluate any proposal touching on social media and the Internet is whether it strengthens or weakens the prospects for a healthy, inclusive democracy, whether it encourages robust debate and respect for our differences, whether it reinforces rule of law and self-governance, whether it helps us make collective decisions based on the best available information, and whether it recognizes the rights and freedoms and dignity of all our citizens.</p>\n<p>Whatever changes contribute to that vision, I\u2019m for. Whatever erodes that vision, I\u2019m against, just so you know. (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>All right. With that as my starting point, I believe we have to address not just the supply of toxic information, but also the demand for it. On the supply side, tech platforms need to accept that the play a unique role in how we, as a people and people around the world, are consuming information and that their decisions have an impact on every aspect of society. With that power comes accountability, and in democracies like ours, at least, the need for some democratic oversight.</p>\n<p>For years, social media companies have resisted that kind of accountability. They\u2019re not unique in that regard. Every private corporation wants to do anything it wants. So, the social media platforms called themselves neutral platforms with no editorial role in what their users saw. They insisted that the content people see on social media has no impact on their beliefs or behavior\u200a\u2014\u200a(laughter)\u200a\u2014\u200aeven though their business models and their profits are based on telling advertisers the exact opposite.</p>\n<p>Now, the good news is, is that almost all the big tech platforms now acknowledge some responsibility for content on their platforms, and they\u2019re investing in large teams of people to monitor it. Given the sheer volume of content, this strategy can feel like a game of whack-a-mole. Still, in talking to people at these companies, I believe they are sincere in trying to limit content that engages in hate speech, encourages violence, or poses a threat to public safety. They genuinely are concerned about it and they want to do something about\u00a0it.</p>\n<p>But while content moderation can limit the distribution of clearly dangerous content, it doesn\u2019t go far enough. Users who want to spread disinformation have become experts at pushing right up to the line of what at least published company policies allow. And at those margins, social media platforms tend not to want to do anything, not just because they don\u2019t want to be accused of censorship, because they still have a financial incentive to keep as many users engaged as possible. More importantly, these companies are still way too guarded about how exactly their standards operate, or how their engagement ranking systems influence what goes viral and what\u00a0doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Now, some companies have been taking the next step in managing toxic content, experimenting with new product designs that, to use just one example, add friction to slow the spread of potentially harmful content. And that kind of innovation is a step in the right direction. It should be applauded, but I also think decisions like this shouldn\u2019t be left solely to private interests. These decisions affect all of us, and just like every other industry that has a big impact in our society, that means these big platforms need to be subject to some level of public oversight and regulation.</p>\n<p>Right now, a lot of the regulatory debate centers on Section 230 of the United States code, which, as some of you know, says the tech companies generally can\u2019t be held liable for most content that other people post on their platforms. But let\u2019s face it, these platforms are not like the old phone\u00a0company.</p>\n<p>While I\u2019m not convinced that wholesale repeal of Section 230 is the answer, it is clear that tech companies have changed dramatically over the last 20 years. And we need to consider reforms to Section 230 to account for those changes, including whether platforms should be required to have a higher standard of care, when it comes to advertising on their\u00a0site.</p>\n<p>And by the way, I believe and I\u2019ve seen that regulation and innovation are not mutually exclusive. Here in the United States, we have a long history of regulating new technologies in the name of public safety, from cars and airplanes to prescription drugs to appliances. And while companies initially always complain that the rules are going to stifle innovation and destroy the industry, the truth is, is that a good regulatory environment usually ends up spurring innovation because it raises the bar on safety and\u00a0quality.</p>\n<p>And it turns out that innovation can meet that higher bar. And if consumers trust that new technology is doing right by them and is safe, they\u2019re more likely to use it. And if properly structured, regulation can promote competition and keep incumbents from freezing out new innovators.</p>\n<p>A regulatory structure, a smart one, needs to be in place, designed in consultation with tech companies, and experts and communities that are affected, including communities of color and others that sometimes are not well represented here in Silicon Valley, that will allow these companies to operate effectively while also slowing the spread of harmful content. In some cases, industry standards may replace or substitute for regulation, but regulation has to be part of the\u00a0answer.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, tech companies need to be more transparent about how they operate. So much of the conversation around disinformation is focused on what people post. The bigger issue is what content these platforms promote. Algorithms have evolved to the point where nobody on the outside of these companies can accurately predict what they\u2019ll do, unless they\u2019re really sophisticated and spend a lot of time tracking it. And sometimes, even the people who build them aren\u2019t sure. That\u2019s a\u00a0problem.</p>\n<p>In a democracy, we can rightly expect companies to subject the design of their products and services to some level of scrutiny. At minimum, they should have to share that information with researchers and regulators who are charged with keeping the rest of the\u00a0safe.</p>\n<p>This may seem like an odd example and forgive me, you vegans out there, but if a meat packing company has a proprietary technique to keep our hot dogs fresh and clean, they don\u2019t have to reveal to the world what that technique is. They do have to tell the meat inspector.</p>\n<p>In the same way, tech companies should be able to protect their intellectual property while also following certain safety standards that we, as a country, not just them, have agreed are necessary for the greater good. And we\u2019ve seen this as part of the Platform Accountability and Transparency Act that\u2019s being proposed by a bipartisan group of senators here in the United States. It doesn\u2019t happen often. And we\u2019ve also seen it negotiated in Europe as part of the European Union\u2019s Digital Services\u00a0Act.</p>\n<p>Again, we don\u2019t expect tech companies to solve all these problems on their own. There are folks in these companies and in this community who have shown extraordinary good faith in some cases, but that\u2019s not\u00a0enough.</p>\n<p>We do expect these companies to affirm the importance of our democratic institutions, not dismiss them, and to work to find the right combination of regulation and industry standards that will make democracy stronger. And because companies recognize the often dangerous relationship between social media, nationalism, domestic hate groups, they do need to engage with vulnerable populations about how to put better safeguards in place to protect minority populations, ethnic populations, religious minorities, wherever they\u00a0operate.</p>\n<p>For example, in the United States, they should be working with, not always contrary to, those groups that are trying to prevent voter suppression and specifically has targeted black and brown communities. In other words, these companies need to have some other North Star other than just making money and increasing market share. Fix the problem that, in part, they helped create, but also to stand for something bigger.</p>\n<p>And to the employees of these companies, and to the students here at Stanford who might well be future employees of these companies, you have the power to move things in the right direction. You can advocate for change; you can be part of this redesign. And if not, you can vote with your feet and go work with companies that are trying to do the right\u00a0thing.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s on the supply side. Now, let\u2019s talk about the demand side of the equation.</p>\n<p>It starts with breaking through our information bubbles. Look, I understand that there are a whole bunch of people in this country who have views diametrically opposed to mine. I promise, they tell me all the time. (Laughter.) I get it. I am not suggesting that all of us have to spend our days reading opinions we disagree with or looking for media stories that fundamentally don\u2019t share our values, but it is possible to broaden our perspectives.</p>\n<p>An interesting study came out recently, and this is just one study, so take it with a grain of salt. The researchers paid a large group of regular FOX News watchers to watch CNN for almost a month. And these were not swing voters, these were hard core, Hannity, Carlson fans, right? They\u2019re right\u00a0there.</p>\n<p>And what the researchers found was that, at the end of the month, people\u2019s views on certain issues, like whether voting by mail should be allowed or whether electing Joe Biden would lead to more violence against police, on some of these issues, their views are changed by five, eight, 10 points. These people didn\u2019t suddenly turn into liberals. I am sure they still don\u2019t like me. (Laughter.) But at the margins, they had reshaped their perspectives in meaningful ways.</p>\n<p>Studies like this show our opinions aren\u2019t fixed, and that means our divisions aren\u2019t fixed either if we can agree on some common baseline effects and agree on some common baseline of how we debate and sort out our disagreements.</p>\n<p>The divisions that exist in this country aren\u2019t going away any time soon, but the information we get, the stories we tell ourselves can, as Lincoln said, encourage the better angels of our nature. It can also encourage the worst. And a healthy democracy depends on our better angels being encouraged.</p>\n<p>As citizens, we have to take it upon ourselves to become better consumers of news, looking at sources, thinking before we share and teaching our kids to become critical thinkers who know how to evaluate sources and separate opinion from fact. In fact, a number of school districts around the country are working to train kids in this kind of online media literacy, not around any particular ideological perspective, but just how to check a source. Does this person who\u2019s typing in his mother\u2019s basement in his underwear seem a credible authority on climate change? (Laughter.) That\u2019s something we should all want to\u00a0support.</p>\n<p>Part of this project is also going to require us to find creative ways to reinvigorate quality journalism, including local journalism, because one of the challenges we have, part of the reason that you\u2019ve seen increased polarization, is all media has become nationalized and hence, more ideological.</p>\n<p>And one encouraging trend has been a number of nonprofit newsrooms beginning to pop up in places like Baltimore, Houston, my hometown of Chicago, all aimed at providing essential coverage of what\u2019s happening locally and in statehouses. And that\u2019s an example of how new models of journalism are possible, along with smart ways for communities to reinvigorate local\u00a0news.</p>\n<p>Companies here in Silicon Valley that have reaped some of the largest benefits from the Internet revolution, those companies need to find ways to support them. And I know Congress has been engaged with some of these companies to look at how can you get more revenue back into local\u00a0news.</p>\n<p>We should also think about how to build civic institutions for a new generation. I mentioned the decline of what are called mediating institutions\u200a\u2014\u200aunions, Rotary clubs, bowling leagues, right? But the thing is, studies show that if you participated in an organization, like Student Council, which I did not\u200a\u2014\u200a(laughter)\u200a\u2014\u200aor the Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts, groups that allow young people to practice learning, debating, voting, making decisions together, then you\u2019re much more likely to vote and be an active\u00a0citizen.</p>\n<p>Those habits matter. We need to figure out ways to give young people and the rest of us the chance to build up civic muscles. And we have to figure out how to do that, not just in the real world, but also on virtual platforms where young people are spending\u00a0time.</p>\n<p>This is one of the things we\u2019re focused on at the Obama Foundation. And great work is also being done by organizations like the MIT Center for Constructive Communication, which is making online conversations more civil and productive, and the News Literacy Project, which is building new tools to help people separate fact from\u00a0fiction.</p>\n<p>And finally, it is important to reinforce these norms and values on an international scale. This is a globally integrated Internet. There\u2019s value in that, but it means that as we\u2019re shaping roles, we have to engage the rest of the\u00a0world.</p>\n<p>Countries like China and Russia have already tried to paint democracy as unworkable, and authoritarianism is the only path to order. China\u2019s built a great firewall around the Internet, turning it into a vehicle for domestic indoctrination and surveillance. And now, they\u2019re exporting some of those same technologies, those same with similar product designs to other countries.</p>\n<p>In Russia, Putin has weaponized ethnonationalism through disinformation, waging hate campaigns against domestic opponents, delegitimizing democracy itself. And of course, he\u2019s escalated such efforts as part of his war in\u00a0Ukraine.</p>\n<p>As the world\u2019s leading democracy, we have to set a better example. We should be at the lead on these discussions internationally, not in the rear. Right now, Europe is forging ahead with some of the most sweeping legislation nearest regulate the abuses that are seen in big tech companies. And their approach may not be exactly right for the United States, but it points to the need for us to coordinate with other democracies.</p>\n<p>We need to find our voice in this global conversation, and we\u2019ve done it before. After World War II, after witnessing how mass media and propaganda had fanned the flames of hate, we put a framework in place that would ensure our broadcast system was compatible with democracy. We required a certain amount of children\u2019s educational programing, instituted the Fairness Doctrine. Newsrooms changed practices to maximize accuracy.</p>\n<p>And the task before us is harder now. We can\u2019t go back to the way things were with three TV stations and newspapers in every major city, not just because of the proliferation of content, but because that content can now move around the world in an instant. And yes, our societies are far more polarized today than they were in the \u201950s and \u201960s right after the war. And yes, progress will require tradeoffs and hard choices, and we won\u2019t get it right all at once. But that\u2019s how democracy works.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not going to strain this metaphor, but if you think about the U.S. Constitution as software for running a society, really innovative design. It, too, had some pretty big initial bugs. Slavery\u200a\u2014\u200a(laughter)\u200a\u2014\u200ayou\u2019re discriminating against entire classes of people. Women couldn\u2019t vote. Even white men without property couldn\u2019t vote, couldn\u2019t participate. What part of, \u201cWe, the people?\u201d So, we came up with a bunch of patches, the 13th Amendment, the 14th Amendment, 15th Amendment, 19th Amendment. We continued to perfect our\u00a0union.</p>\n<p>And the good news is we\u2019ve got a new generation of activists that seem to be ready to keep moving. Besides Tiana, who introduced me, I\u2019ve had the privilege of meeting young leaders in our Obama Foundation network, like Timothy Franklyn, who founded the National School of Journalism and Public Discourse in India, to train journalists who are committed to justice and democracy in that country; or Sandor Lederer from Hungary, who founded K-Monitor. That\u2019s a group that helps average citizens understand how public money is spent and flags potential corruption; or Juliana Tafur, who\u2019s using documentary film and curated workshops to reduce polarization and help Americans connect across differences.</p>\n<p>Young people everywhere are recognizing that this is a problem. They\u2019re not just griping about it, they\u2019re doing their part to fix it. And the rest of us need to follow their\u00a0lead.</p>\n<p>But these idealistic, innovative young people, they\u2019re going to need those of us who are already in positions of power, those of us like me who have a platform to get our act together. If Congress is too polarized to pass anything, we probably won\u2019t make the kind of progress we need. If Republican elected officials with a few notable courageous exceptions, and I\u2019m not going to mention them, because I don\u2019t want them to be criticized for having been praised by me\u200a\u2014\u200a(laughter)\u200a\u2014\u200abut if the vast majority of elected Republican officials keep insisting that there\u2019s nothing wrong with saying an election was stolen without a shred of evidence, when they know better, this isn\u2019t going to\u00a0work.</p>\n<p>Each of us, whether we work at a tech company or consume social media, whether we are a parent, a legislator, an advertiser on one of these platforms, now\u2019s the time to pick a side. We have a choice right now. Do we allow our democracy to wither or do we make it better? That\u2019s the choice we face, and it is a choice worth embracing.</p>\n<p>In the early days of the Internet and social media, it was a certain joy in finding new ways to connect, and organize and stay informed. There was so much promise. I know, I was there. And right now, just like politics itself, just like our public lives, social media has a grimness to it. We\u2019re so fatalistic about the steady stream of bile and vitriol that\u2019s on there, but it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. In fact, if we\u2019re going to succeed, it can\u2019t be that\u00a0way.</p>\n<p>All of us have an opportunity to do what America has always done at our best, which is to recognize that even when the source code is working, the status quo isn\u2019t, and we can build something better together. This is an opportunity. It\u2019s a chance that we should welcome for governments to take on a big, important problem and prove that democracy and innovation can coexist. It\u2019s a chance for companies to do the right thing. You\u2019ll still make money, but you\u2019ll feel better. (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a chance for employees of those companies to push them to do the right thing, because you\u2019ve seen what\u2019s out there and you want to feel better. It\u2019s a chance for journalists and their supporters to figure out how do we adapt old institutions and those core values that made those institutions valuable? How do we adapt that to a new\u00a0age?</p>\n<p>It is a chance for all of us to fight for truth, not absolute truth, not a fixed truth, but to fight for what, deep down, we know is more true, is right. It\u2019s a chance for us to do that not just because we\u2019re afraid of what will happen if we don\u2019t, but because we\u2019re hopeful about what can happen if we\u00a0do.</p>\n<p>Over the last couple of months, we\u2019ve seen what it looks like when a society loses the ability to distinguish truth from fiction. Mike McFaul and I were talking backstage, and my first time in Moscow as president, we gathered with all these civic activists. Putin at that time had receded from the foreground, and you had all these folks who are working to make Russia better. And we were reminiscing and thinking about that moment of possibility and what might have happened to\u00a0him.</p>\n<p>And now, in Russia, those who control the information have led public opinion further and further and further and further away from the facts, until all of a sudden, almost a quarter of the country\u2019s combat power has been damaged or destroyed in what the government is claiming is a, quote, special military operation. That\u2019s what happens when societies lose track of what is\u00a0true.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the last couple of months have also shown what can happen when the world pushes back. We have seen it in the people, including some of our Obama leaders in Europe who are organizing on social media to help Ukrainian refugees, offering food and shelter and jobs and rides. We\u2019ve seen IT in an army of volunteers who work to break through Russia propaganda and reach out to mothers of Russian soldiers, asking them to call on Putin to bring their sons home. And we\u2019ve seen it in the combination of old and new media like a viral image of a Russian TV editor walking into a live shot with a handwritten sign, calling for an end to the\u00a0war.</p>\n<p>The handwritten sign was a tool. TV\u2019s a tool. The Internet is a tool. Social media is a tool. At the end of the day, tools don\u2019t control us. We control them, and we can remake them. It\u2019s up to each of us to decide what we value, and then use the tools we\u2019ve been given to advance those values. And I believe we should use every tool at our disposal to secure our greatest gift, a government of, by, for the people for generations to come. And I hope you agree with me, and I look forward to you joining in the\u00a0work.</p>\n<p>Thank you very much, everybody.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=7d7af7ba28af\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n","content":"\n<h4><em>Tech platforms need to recognize that their decisions have an impact on every aspect of\u00a0society.</em></h4>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*UFqcDewpKjIfIimN50W0Eg.jpeg\"></figure><p>Hello, Stanford. It is great to be in California and back in beautiful Palo Alto. Coming here always makes me want to go back to college, although an 18-year-old Barack Obama would not have gotten in. I got more serious,\u00a0later.</p>\n<p>I want to thank the Cyber Policy Center here at Stanford for hosting this event. I want to thank Tiana for that outstanding introduction, and for all the work that you are doing. I want to thank a great friend and a remarkable public servant and Ambassador of Russia, during very difficult times, and one of my top advisors, Michael McFaul, for being\u00a0here.</p>\n<p>Michelle and I set up the Obama Foundation to train the next generation of leaders, and I think you saw in Tiana, the example of the kind of remarkable leadership that\u2019s out there, with the talent and vision to lead us forward, as long as old people get out of the\u00a0way.</p>\n<p>During some of the darkest days of World War II, American philosopher, Reinhold Niebuhr, wrote the following, \u201cMan\u2019s capacity for justice makes democracy possible, but man\u2019s inclination to injustice makes democracy necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p>We\u2019re living through another tumultuous, dangerous moment in history. All of us have been horrified by Russia\u2019s brutal invasion of the Ukraine. A nuclear-armed despot\u2019s response to a neighboring state whose only provocation is its desire to be independent and democratic. An invasion of this scale hasn\u2019t been seen in Europe since World War II, and we\u2019ve all witnessed the resulting death and destruction, and the displacement, in real\u00a0time.</p>\n<p>The stakes are enormous, and the courage displayed by ordinary Ukrainians has been extraordinary and demands our support. Unfortunately, a war in the Ukraine isn\u2019t happening in a vacuum. Vladimir Putin\u2019s aggression is part of a larger trend, even if similar levels of oppression and lawless and violence and suffering don\u2019t always attract the same levels of attention if they happen outside of\u00a0Europe,</p>\n<p>Autocrats and aspiring strongmen have become emboldened around the globe. They\u2019re actively subverting democracy, they\u2019re undermining hard-won human rights, they\u2019re ignoring international law.</p>\n<p>Democratic backsliding is not restricted to distant lands. Right here, in the United States of America, we just saw a sitting president deny the clear results of an election and help incite a violent insurrection at the nation\u2019s capital. Not only that, but a majority of his party, including many who occupy some of the highest offices in the land, continue to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the last election, and are using it to justify laws that restrict the vote, making it easier to overturn the will of the people in states where they hold\u00a0power.</p>\n<p>But for those of us who believe in democracy and the rule of law, this should serve as a wake-up call. We have to admit that, at least in the years since the Cold War ended, democracies have grown dangerously complacent.</p>\n<p>Too often, we\u2019ve taken freedom for granted. What recent events remind us, is that democracy is neither inevitable nor self-executed. Citizens like us have to nurture it. We have to tend to it and fight for it, and as our circumstances change, we have to be willing to look at ourselves critically, making reforms that can allow democracy, not just to survive, but to\u00a0thrive.</p>\n<p>That won\u2019t be easy. A lot of factors have contributed to the weakening of democratic institutions around the world. One of those factors is globalization which has helped lift hundreds and millions out of poverty, most notably in China and India, but which, along with automation has also ended entire economies, accelerated global inequality, and left millions of others feeling betrayed and angry at existing political institutions.</p>\n<p>There is the increased mobility and urbanization of modern life, which further shakes up societies, including existing family structures and gender roles. Here at home, we\u2019ve seen a steady decline in the number of people participating in unions, civic organizations and houses of worship, mediating institutions that once served as a kind of communal\u00a0glue.</p>\n<p>Internationally, the rise of China as well as chronic political dysfunction, here in the U.S. and in Europe, not to mention the near collapse of the global financial system in 2008, has made it easier for leaders in other countries to discount democracy\u2019s appeal. And as once marginalized groups demand a seat at the table, politicians have found a new audience for old-fashioned appeals to racial and ethnic, religious or national solidarity.</p>\n<p>In the rush to protect us from them, virtues like tolerance and respect for democratic processes start to look, not just expendable, but like a threat to our way of\u00a0life.</p>\n<p>So if we\u2019re going to strengthen democracy, we\u2019ll have to address all of these strengths. We\u2019ll have to come up with new models for a more inclusive, equitable capitalism. We\u2019ll have to reform our political institutions in ways that allow people to be heard and give them real agency. We\u2019ll have to tell better stories about ourselves and how we can live together, despite our differences.</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s why I\u2019m here today, on Stanford\u2019s campus, in the heart of Silicon Valley, where so much of the digital, because I\u2019m convinced that right now one of the biggest impediments to doing all of this, indeed, of the biggest reasons for democracies weakening is the profound change that\u2019s taking place in how we communicate and consume information.</p>\n<p>Now let me start off by saying I am not a Luddite, although it is true that sometimes I have to ask my daughters how to work basic functions on my phone. I am amazed by the internet. It\u2019s connected billions of people around the world, put the collected knowledge of centuries at our fingertips. It\u2019s made our economies vastly more efficient, accelerated medical advances, opened up new opportunities, allowed people with shared interests to find each\u00a0other.</p>\n<p>I might never have been elected president if it hadn\u2019t been for websites like, and I\u2019m dating myself, MySpace, MeetUp and Facebook who allowed an army of young volunteers to organize, raise money, spread our message. That\u2019s what elected\u00a0me.</p>\n<p>And since then, we\u2019ve all witnessed the ways that activists use social media platforms to register dissent and shine a light on injustice and mobilize people on issues like climate change and racial\u00a0justice.</p>\n<p>So the internet and the accompanying information revolution has been transformative. And there\u2019s no turning back. But like all advances in technology, this progress has had unintended consequences that sometimes come at a price. And in this case, we see that our new information ecosystem is turbocharging some of humanity\u2019s worst impulses.</p>\n<p>Not all of these effects are intentional or even avoidable. They\u2019re simply the consequence of billions of humans suddenly plugged in one instant 24/7 global information stream. Forty years ago, if you were a conservative in rural Texas, you weren\u2019t necessarily offended by what was going on in San Francisco\u2019s Castro District because you didn\u2019t know what was going\u00a0on.</p>\n<p>If you lived in an impoverished Yemeni village, you had no insight into the spending habits of the Kardashians. For some such exposure may be eye opening, perhaps even liberating, but others may experience that exposure as a direct affront to their traditions, their belief systems, their place in society. Then you have the sheer proliferation of content and the splintering of information and audiences. That\u2019s made democracy more complicated.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll date myself again. If you were watching TV here in the United States between about 1960 and 1990, <em>I Dream of Jeannie</em>, <em>The Jeffersons</em>. Chances are you were watching one of the big three networks. And this had its own problems, particularly the ways in which programing often excluded voices and perspectives of women and people of color and other folks outside of the mainstream. But it did fortify a sense of shared culture and it came to the news, at least, citizens across the political spectrum tended to operate using a shared set of facts, what they saw, what they heard from Walter Cronkite or David Brinkley or\u00a0others.</p>\n<p>Today, of course, we occupy entirely different media realities, fed directly into our phones. You don\u2019t even have to look up. And it\u2019s made all of us more prone to what psychologists call confirmation bias, the tendency to select facts and opinions that reinforce our preexisting worldviews and filter out those that\u00a0don\u2019t.</p>\n<p>So inside our personal information bubbles, our assumptions, our blind spots, our prejudices aren\u2019t challenged, they\u2019re reinforced. And naturally we\u2019re more likely to react negatively to those consuming different facts and opinions. All of which deepens existing racial and religious and cultural\u00a0divides.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s fair to say then that some of the current challenges we face are inherent to a fully connected world. Our brains aren\u2019t accustomed to taking in this much information this fast, and a lot of us are experiencing overload. But not all problems we\u2019re seeing now are a byproduct of this new technology. They\u2019re also the result of very specific choices made by the companies that have come to dominate the internet generally and social media platforms in particular. Decisions that, intentionally or not, have made democracies more vulnerable.</p>\n<p>Now I\u2019m at Stanford. Most of you know the story by now. Twenty years ago, pillars of web search were comprehensiveness, relevance and speed. But with the rise of social media and the need to better understand people\u2019s online behavior, in order to sell more advertising, companies want to collect more data. More companies optimized for personalization, engagement and speed. And unfortunately, it turns out that inflammatory, polarizing content attracts and\u00a0engages.</p>\n<p>Other features of these platforms have compounded the problem. For example, the way content looks on your phone, as well as the veil of anonymity that platforms provide their users. A lot of times this makes it impossible to tell the difference between, say, a peer-reviewed article by Dr. Anthony Fauci and a miracle cure being pitched by a huckster.</p>\n<p>And meanwhile, sophisticated actors from political consultants to commercial interests, to intelligence arms of foreign powers can game platform algorithms or artificially boost the reach of the deceptive or harmful messages.</p>\n<p>Of course, this business model has proven to be wildly successful. For more and more of us, search and social media platforms aren\u2019t just our window into the internet; they serve as our primary source of news and information.</p>\n<p>No one tells us that the window is blurred, subject to unseen distortions and subtle manipulations. All we see is a constant feed of content where useful factual information and happy diversions, and cat videos, flow alongside lies, conspiracy theories, junk science, quackery, White supremacist, racist tracts, misogynist screeds. And over time, we lose our capacity to distinguish between fact, opinion and wholesale fiction. Or maybe we just stop\u00a0caring.</p>\n<p>And all of us, including our children, learn that if you want to rise above the crowd, above the din, if you want to be liked and shared, and yes, go viral! Then peddling controversy, outrage, even hate often gives you an\u00a0edge.</p>\n<p>Now it\u2019s true, tech companies and social media platforms are not the only distributors of toxic information. I promise you; I spend a lot of time in Washington, right?</p>\n<p>In fact, some of the most outrageous content on the Web originates from traditional media. What social media platforms have done, though, thanks to their increasing market dominance and their emphasis on speed, is accelerate the decline of newspapers and other traditional news\u00a0sources.</p>\n<p>There are still brand name newspapers and magazines, not to mention network news broadcasts, NPR other outlets that have adapted to the new digital environment while maintaining the highest standards of journalistic integrity. But as more and more ad revenue flows to the platforms that disseminate the news, rather than that money going to the newsrooms that report it, publishers, reporters, editors, they all feel the pressure to maximize engagement in order to\u00a0compete.</p>\n<p>Reporters start worrying about, \u201cI gotta tweet something, cause if I don\u2019t, I may be out of a job.\u201d That\u2019s the information environment we now live in. It\u2019s not just that these platforms have\u200a\u2014\u200aand there are exceptions\u200a\u2014\u200abeen largely agnostic regarding the kind of information available and connections made on their sites. It\u2019s that in the competition between truth and falsehood, cooperation and conflict, the very design of these platforms seems to be tilting us in the wrong direction.</p>\n<p>And we\u2019re seeing the results take over. The fact that scientists developed safe, effective vaccines in record time is an unbelievable achievement. And yet despite the fact that we\u2019ve now, essentially clinically tested the vaccine on billions of people worldwide, around 1 in 5 Americans is still willing to put themselves at risk and put their families at risk rather than get vaccinated. People are dying because of misinformation.</p>\n<p>I already mentioned the 2020 presidential election. President Trump\u2019s own attorney general has said that the Justice Department uncovered no evidence of widespread voter fraud. A review of the ballots in Arizona\u2019s largest county, the results of which were endorsed by some pretty courageous local Republicans, because many of them were harassed and received death threats, actually more votes for President Biden and fewer votes for President Trump. And yet today, as we speak, a majority of Republicans still insist that President Biden\u2019s victory was not legitimate. That\u2019s a lot of\u00a0people.</p>\n<p>In Myanmar, it\u2019s been well-documented that hate speech shared on Facebook played a role in the murderous campaign targeting the Rohingya community. Social media platforms have been similarly implicated in fanning ethnic violence in Ethiopia, far-right extremism in\u00a0Europe.</p>\n<p>Authoritarian regimes and strongmen around the world from China to Hungary, the Philippines. Brazil have learned to conscript social media platforms to turn their own populations against groups they don\u2019t like, whether it\u2019s ethnic minorities, the LGBTQ community, journalists, political opponents. And of course, autocrats like Putin have used these platforms as a strategic weapon against democratic countries that they consider a\u00a0threat.</p>\n<p>People like Putin and Steve Bannon, for that matter, understand it\u2019s not necessary for people to believe this information in order to weaken democratic institutions. You just have to flood a country\u2019s public square with enough raw sewage. You just have to raise enough questions, spread enough dirt, plant enough conspiracy theorizing that citizens no longer know what to\u00a0believe.</p>\n<p>Once they lose trust in their leaders, in mainstream media, in political institutions, in each other, in the possibility of truth, the game\u2019s won. And as Putin discovered leading up to the 2016 election, our own social media platforms are well designed to support such a mission, such a\u00a0project.</p>\n<p>Russians could study and manipulate patterns in the engagement ranking system on a Facebook or YouTube. And as a result, Russian\u2019s state sponsor trolls could almost guarantee that whatever disinformation they put out there would reach millions of Americans. And that the more inflammatory the story, the quicker it\u00a0spread.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been writing my memoirs lately, including reflections on events leading up to that election. The regrets I have, the things I might have missed. No one in my administration was surprised that Russia was attempting to meddle in our election. They had been doing that for years. Or that it was using social media in these\u00a0efforts.</p>\n<p>Before the election, I directed our top intelligence officials to expose those efforts to the press and to the public. What does still nag at me, though? Was my failure to fully appreciate at the time just how susceptible we had become to lies and conspiracy theories, despite having spent years being a target of disinformation myself.</p>\n<p>Putin didn\u2019t do that. He didn\u2019t have to. We did it to ourselves.</p>\n<p>So where do we go from\u00a0here?</p>\n<p>If we do nothing, I am convinced the trends that we\u2019re seeing will get worse. New technologies are already challenging the way we regulate currency, how we keep consumers safe from fraud. And with the emergence of AI, disinformation will grow more sophisticated. I\u2019ve already seen demonstrations of deepfake technology that show what looks like me on a screen saying stuff I did not say. It\u2019s a strange experience, people.</p>\n<p>Without some standards, implications of this technology, for our elections, for our legal system, for our democracy, for rules of evidence, for our entire social order are frightening and profound.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, I am convinced that it is possible to preserve the transformative power and promise of the open internet, while at least mitigating the worst of its harms. And I believe that those of you in the tech community, soon to be in the tech community, not just its corporate leaders, but employees at every level have to be part of the solution.</p>\n<p>The essence of this place, what put Silicon Valley on the map is a spirit of innovation. That\u2019s what led to the globally integrated internet, and all its remarkable applications. What we\u2019ve now learned is the product has some design flaws. There are some bugs in the software. We don\u2019t have to just leave it like that. Through the same spirit of innovation. We can make it\u00a0better.</p>\n<p>So I want to make some general suggestions for what that work might look like. But before I do, let me offer a few stipulations so we don\u2019t get bogged down in some well-worn, not always productive arguments.</p>\n<p>Number one, media companies, tech companies, social media platforms did not create the divisions in our society, here or in other parts of the world. Social media did not create racism or white supremacist groups. It didn\u2019t create the kind of ethno-nationalism that. Putin\u2019s enraptured with. It didn\u2019t create sexism, class conflict, religious strife, greed, envy, all the deadly sins. All these things existed long before the first tweet or Facebook\u00a0poke.</p>\n<p>Solving the disinformation problem won\u2019t cure all that ails our democracies or tears at the fabric of our world, but it can help tamp down divisions and let us rebuild the trust and solidarity needed to make our democracy stronger. And to take on anti-women mentalities, and deal with racism in our society, and build bridges between people. It can do\u00a0that.</p>\n<p>Second, we aren\u2019t going to get rid of all offensive or inflammatory content on the web. That is a strawman. We\u2019d be wrong to try. Freedom of speech is at the heart of every democratic society in America those protections are enshrined in the First Amendment to our Constitution. There\u2019s a reason it came first in the Bill of\u00a0Rights.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m pretty close to a First Amendment absolutist. I believe that in most instances the answer to bad speech is good speech. I believe that the free, robust, sometimes antagonistic exchange of ideas produces better outcomes and a healthier society.</p>\n<p>No Democratic government can or should do what China, for example, is doing, simply telling people what they can and cannot say or publish while trying to control what others say about their country abroad. And I don\u2019t have a lot of confidence that any single individual or organization, private or public, should be charged or do a good job at determining who gets to hear\u00a0what.</p>\n<p>That said, the First Amendment is a check on the power of the state. It doesn\u2019t apply to private companies like Facebook or Twitter, any more than it applies to editorial decisions made by <em>The New York Times </em>or Fox News. It never has. Social media companies already make choices about what is or is not allowed on their platforms and how that content appears, both explicitly through content, moderation, and implicitly through algorithms.</p>\n<p>The problem is, we often don\u2019t know what principles govern those decisions. And on an issue of enormous public interest, there has been little public debate and practically no democratic oversight.</p>\n<p>Three, any rules we come up with to govern the distribution of content on the Internet will involve value judgments. None of us are perfectly objective. What we consider unshakeable truth today may prove to be totally wrong tomorrow. But that doesn\u2019t mean some things aren\u2019t truer than others or that we can\u2019t draw lines between opinions, facts, honest mistakes, intentional deceptions.</p>\n<p>We make these distinctions all the time in our daily lives, at work, in school, at home, in sports, and we can do the same when it comes to Internet content, as long as we agree on a set of principles, some core values to guide the work. So, in the interest of full transparency, here\u2019s what I think our guiding principles should\u00a0be.</p>\n<p>The way I\u2019m going to evaluate any proposal touching on social media and the Internet is whether it strengthens or weakens the prospects for a healthy, inclusive democracy, whether it encourages robust debate and respect for our differences, whether it reinforces rule of law and self-governance, whether it helps us make collective decisions based on the best available information, and whether it recognizes the rights and freedoms and dignity of all our citizens.</p>\n<p>Whatever changes contribute to that vision, I\u2019m for. Whatever erodes that vision, I\u2019m against, just so you know. (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>All right. With that as my starting point, I believe we have to address not just the supply of toxic information, but also the demand for it. On the supply side, tech platforms need to accept that the play a unique role in how we, as a people and people around the world, are consuming information and that their decisions have an impact on every aspect of society. With that power comes accountability, and in democracies like ours, at least, the need for some democratic oversight.</p>\n<p>For years, social media companies have resisted that kind of accountability. They\u2019re not unique in that regard. Every private corporation wants to do anything it wants. So, the social media platforms called themselves neutral platforms with no editorial role in what their users saw. They insisted that the content people see on social media has no impact on their beliefs or behavior\u200a\u2014\u200a(laughter)\u200a\u2014\u200aeven though their business models and their profits are based on telling advertisers the exact opposite.</p>\n<p>Now, the good news is, is that almost all the big tech platforms now acknowledge some responsibility for content on their platforms, and they\u2019re investing in large teams of people to monitor it. Given the sheer volume of content, this strategy can feel like a game of whack-a-mole. Still, in talking to people at these companies, I believe they are sincere in trying to limit content that engages in hate speech, encourages violence, or poses a threat to public safety. They genuinely are concerned about it and they want to do something about\u00a0it.</p>\n<p>But while content moderation can limit the distribution of clearly dangerous content, it doesn\u2019t go far enough. Users who want to spread disinformation have become experts at pushing right up to the line of what at least published company policies allow. And at those margins, social media platforms tend not to want to do anything, not just because they don\u2019t want to be accused of censorship, because they still have a financial incentive to keep as many users engaged as possible. More importantly, these companies are still way too guarded about how exactly their standards operate, or how their engagement ranking systems influence what goes viral and what\u00a0doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Now, some companies have been taking the next step in managing toxic content, experimenting with new product designs that, to use just one example, add friction to slow the spread of potentially harmful content. And that kind of innovation is a step in the right direction. It should be applauded, but I also think decisions like this shouldn\u2019t be left solely to private interests. These decisions affect all of us, and just like every other industry that has a big impact in our society, that means these big platforms need to be subject to some level of public oversight and regulation.</p>\n<p>Right now, a lot of the regulatory debate centers on Section 230 of the United States code, which, as some of you know, says the tech companies generally can\u2019t be held liable for most content that other people post on their platforms. But let\u2019s face it, these platforms are not like the old phone\u00a0company.</p>\n<p>While I\u2019m not convinced that wholesale repeal of Section 230 is the answer, it is clear that tech companies have changed dramatically over the last 20 years. And we need to consider reforms to Section 230 to account for those changes, including whether platforms should be required to have a higher standard of care, when it comes to advertising on their\u00a0site.</p>\n<p>And by the way, I believe and I\u2019ve seen that regulation and innovation are not mutually exclusive. Here in the United States, we have a long history of regulating new technologies in the name of public safety, from cars and airplanes to prescription drugs to appliances. And while companies initially always complain that the rules are going to stifle innovation and destroy the industry, the truth is, is that a good regulatory environment usually ends up spurring innovation because it raises the bar on safety and\u00a0quality.</p>\n<p>And it turns out that innovation can meet that higher bar. And if consumers trust that new technology is doing right by them and is safe, they\u2019re more likely to use it. And if properly structured, regulation can promote competition and keep incumbents from freezing out new innovators.</p>\n<p>A regulatory structure, a smart one, needs to be in place, designed in consultation with tech companies, and experts and communities that are affected, including communities of color and others that sometimes are not well represented here in Silicon Valley, that will allow these companies to operate effectively while also slowing the spread of harmful content. In some cases, industry standards may replace or substitute for regulation, but regulation has to be part of the\u00a0answer.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, tech companies need to be more transparent about how they operate. So much of the conversation around disinformation is focused on what people post. The bigger issue is what content these platforms promote. Algorithms have evolved to the point where nobody on the outside of these companies can accurately predict what they\u2019ll do, unless they\u2019re really sophisticated and spend a lot of time tracking it. And sometimes, even the people who build them aren\u2019t sure. That\u2019s a\u00a0problem.</p>\n<p>In a democracy, we can rightly expect companies to subject the design of their products and services to some level of scrutiny. At minimum, they should have to share that information with researchers and regulators who are charged with keeping the rest of the\u00a0safe.</p>\n<p>This may seem like an odd example and forgive me, you vegans out there, but if a meat packing company has a proprietary technique to keep our hot dogs fresh and clean, they don\u2019t have to reveal to the world what that technique is. They do have to tell the meat inspector.</p>\n<p>In the same way, tech companies should be able to protect their intellectual property while also following certain safety standards that we, as a country, not just them, have agreed are necessary for the greater good. And we\u2019ve seen this as part of the Platform Accountability and Transparency Act that\u2019s being proposed by a bipartisan group of senators here in the United States. It doesn\u2019t happen often. And we\u2019ve also seen it negotiated in Europe as part of the European Union\u2019s Digital Services\u00a0Act.</p>\n<p>Again, we don\u2019t expect tech companies to solve all these problems on their own. There are folks in these companies and in this community who have shown extraordinary good faith in some cases, but that\u2019s not\u00a0enough.</p>\n<p>We do expect these companies to affirm the importance of our democratic institutions, not dismiss them, and to work to find the right combination of regulation and industry standards that will make democracy stronger. And because companies recognize the often dangerous relationship between social media, nationalism, domestic hate groups, they do need to engage with vulnerable populations about how to put better safeguards in place to protect minority populations, ethnic populations, religious minorities, wherever they\u00a0operate.</p>\n<p>For example, in the United States, they should be working with, not always contrary to, those groups that are trying to prevent voter suppression and specifically has targeted black and brown communities. In other words, these companies need to have some other North Star other than just making money and increasing market share. Fix the problem that, in part, they helped create, but also to stand for something bigger.</p>\n<p>And to the employees of these companies, and to the students here at Stanford who might well be future employees of these companies, you have the power to move things in the right direction. You can advocate for change; you can be part of this redesign. And if not, you can vote with your feet and go work with companies that are trying to do the right\u00a0thing.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s on the supply side. Now, let\u2019s talk about the demand side of the equation.</p>\n<p>It starts with breaking through our information bubbles. Look, I understand that there are a whole bunch of people in this country who have views diametrically opposed to mine. I promise, they tell me all the time. (Laughter.) I get it. I am not suggesting that all of us have to spend our days reading opinions we disagree with or looking for media stories that fundamentally don\u2019t share our values, but it is possible to broaden our perspectives.</p>\n<p>An interesting study came out recently, and this is just one study, so take it with a grain of salt. The researchers paid a large group of regular FOX News watchers to watch CNN for almost a month. And these were not swing voters, these were hard core, Hannity, Carlson fans, right? They\u2019re right\u00a0there.</p>\n<p>And what the researchers found was that, at the end of the month, people\u2019s views on certain issues, like whether voting by mail should be allowed or whether electing Joe Biden would lead to more violence against police, on some of these issues, their views are changed by five, eight, 10 points. These people didn\u2019t suddenly turn into liberals. I am sure they still don\u2019t like me. (Laughter.) But at the margins, they had reshaped their perspectives in meaningful ways.</p>\n<p>Studies like this show our opinions aren\u2019t fixed, and that means our divisions aren\u2019t fixed either if we can agree on some common baseline effects and agree on some common baseline of how we debate and sort out our disagreements.</p>\n<p>The divisions that exist in this country aren\u2019t going away any time soon, but the information we get, the stories we tell ourselves can, as Lincoln said, encourage the better angels of our nature. It can also encourage the worst. And a healthy democracy depends on our better angels being encouraged.</p>\n<p>As citizens, we have to take it upon ourselves to become better consumers of news, looking at sources, thinking before we share and teaching our kids to become critical thinkers who know how to evaluate sources and separate opinion from fact. In fact, a number of school districts around the country are working to train kids in this kind of online media literacy, not around any particular ideological perspective, but just how to check a source. Does this person who\u2019s typing in his mother\u2019s basement in his underwear seem a credible authority on climate change? (Laughter.) That\u2019s something we should all want to\u00a0support.</p>\n<p>Part of this project is also going to require us to find creative ways to reinvigorate quality journalism, including local journalism, because one of the challenges we have, part of the reason that you\u2019ve seen increased polarization, is all media has become nationalized and hence, more ideological.</p>\n<p>And one encouraging trend has been a number of nonprofit newsrooms beginning to pop up in places like Baltimore, Houston, my hometown of Chicago, all aimed at providing essential coverage of what\u2019s happening locally and in statehouses. And that\u2019s an example of how new models of journalism are possible, along with smart ways for communities to reinvigorate local\u00a0news.</p>\n<p>Companies here in Silicon Valley that have reaped some of the largest benefits from the Internet revolution, those companies need to find ways to support them. And I know Congress has been engaged with some of these companies to look at how can you get more revenue back into local\u00a0news.</p>\n<p>We should also think about how to build civic institutions for a new generation. I mentioned the decline of what are called mediating institutions\u200a\u2014\u200aunions, Rotary clubs, bowling leagues, right? But the thing is, studies show that if you participated in an organization, like Student Council, which I did not\u200a\u2014\u200a(laughter)\u200a\u2014\u200aor the Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts, groups that allow young people to practice learning, debating, voting, making decisions together, then you\u2019re much more likely to vote and be an active\u00a0citizen.</p>\n<p>Those habits matter. We need to figure out ways to give young people and the rest of us the chance to build up civic muscles. And we have to figure out how to do that, not just in the real world, but also on virtual platforms where young people are spending\u00a0time.</p>\n<p>This is one of the things we\u2019re focused on at the Obama Foundation. And great work is also being done by organizations like the MIT Center for Constructive Communication, which is making online conversations more civil and productive, and the News Literacy Project, which is building new tools to help people separate fact from\u00a0fiction.</p>\n<p>And finally, it is important to reinforce these norms and values on an international scale. This is a globally integrated Internet. There\u2019s value in that, but it means that as we\u2019re shaping roles, we have to engage the rest of the\u00a0world.</p>\n<p>Countries like China and Russia have already tried to paint democracy as unworkable, and authoritarianism is the only path to order. China\u2019s built a great firewall around the Internet, turning it into a vehicle for domestic indoctrination and surveillance. And now, they\u2019re exporting some of those same technologies, those same with similar product designs to other countries.</p>\n<p>In Russia, Putin has weaponized ethnonationalism through disinformation, waging hate campaigns against domestic opponents, delegitimizing democracy itself. And of course, he\u2019s escalated such efforts as part of his war in\u00a0Ukraine.</p>\n<p>As the world\u2019s leading democracy, we have to set a better example. We should be at the lead on these discussions internationally, not in the rear. Right now, Europe is forging ahead with some of the most sweeping legislation nearest regulate the abuses that are seen in big tech companies. And their approach may not be exactly right for the United States, but it points to the need for us to coordinate with other democracies.</p>\n<p>We need to find our voice in this global conversation, and we\u2019ve done it before. After World War II, after witnessing how mass media and propaganda had fanned the flames of hate, we put a framework in place that would ensure our broadcast system was compatible with democracy. We required a certain amount of children\u2019s educational programing, instituted the Fairness Doctrine. Newsrooms changed practices to maximize accuracy.</p>\n<p>And the task before us is harder now. We can\u2019t go back to the way things were with three TV stations and newspapers in every major city, not just because of the proliferation of content, but because that content can now move around the world in an instant. And yes, our societies are far more polarized today than they were in the \u201950s and \u201960s right after the war. And yes, progress will require tradeoffs and hard choices, and we won\u2019t get it right all at once. But that\u2019s how democracy works.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not going to strain this metaphor, but if you think about the U.S. Constitution as software for running a society, really innovative design. It, too, had some pretty big initial bugs. Slavery\u200a\u2014\u200a(laughter)\u200a\u2014\u200ayou\u2019re discriminating against entire classes of people. Women couldn\u2019t vote. Even white men without property couldn\u2019t vote, couldn\u2019t participate. What part of, \u201cWe, the people?\u201d So, we came up with a bunch of patches, the 13th Amendment, the 14th Amendment, 15th Amendment, 19th Amendment. We continued to perfect our\u00a0union.</p>\n<p>And the good news is we\u2019ve got a new generation of activists that seem to be ready to keep moving. Besides Tiana, who introduced me, I\u2019ve had the privilege of meeting young leaders in our Obama Foundation network, like Timothy Franklyn, who founded the National School of Journalism and Public Discourse in India, to train journalists who are committed to justice and democracy in that country; or Sandor Lederer from Hungary, who founded K-Monitor. That\u2019s a group that helps average citizens understand how public money is spent and flags potential corruption; or Juliana Tafur, who\u2019s using documentary film and curated workshops to reduce polarization and help Americans connect across differences.</p>\n<p>Young people everywhere are recognizing that this is a problem. They\u2019re not just griping about it, they\u2019re doing their part to fix it. And the rest of us need to follow their\u00a0lead.</p>\n<p>But these idealistic, innovative young people, they\u2019re going to need those of us who are already in positions of power, those of us like me who have a platform to get our act together. If Congress is too polarized to pass anything, we probably won\u2019t make the kind of progress we need. If Republican elected officials with a few notable courageous exceptions, and I\u2019m not going to mention them, because I don\u2019t want them to be criticized for having been praised by me\u200a\u2014\u200a(laughter)\u200a\u2014\u200abut if the vast majority of elected Republican officials keep insisting that there\u2019s nothing wrong with saying an election was stolen without a shred of evidence, when they know better, this isn\u2019t going to\u00a0work.</p>\n<p>Each of us, whether we work at a tech company or consume social media, whether we are a parent, a legislator, an advertiser on one of these platforms, now\u2019s the time to pick a side. We have a choice right now. Do we allow our democracy to wither or do we make it better? That\u2019s the choice we face, and it is a choice worth embracing.</p>\n<p>In the early days of the Internet and social media, it was a certain joy in finding new ways to connect, and organize and stay informed. There was so much promise. I know, I was there. And right now, just like politics itself, just like our public lives, social media has a grimness to it. We\u2019re so fatalistic about the steady stream of bile and vitriol that\u2019s on there, but it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. In fact, if we\u2019re going to succeed, it can\u2019t be that\u00a0way.</p>\n<p>All of us have an opportunity to do what America has always done at our best, which is to recognize that even when the source code is working, the status quo isn\u2019t, and we can build something better together. This is an opportunity. It\u2019s a chance that we should welcome for governments to take on a big, important problem and prove that democracy and innovation can coexist. It\u2019s a chance for companies to do the right thing. You\u2019ll still make money, but you\u2019ll feel better. (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a chance for employees of those companies to push them to do the right thing, because you\u2019ve seen what\u2019s out there and you want to feel better. It\u2019s a chance for journalists and their supporters to figure out how do we adapt old institutions and those core values that made those institutions valuable? How do we adapt that to a new\u00a0age?</p>\n<p>It is a chance for all of us to fight for truth, not absolute truth, not a fixed truth, but to fight for what, deep down, we know is more true, is right. It\u2019s a chance for us to do that not just because we\u2019re afraid of what will happen if we don\u2019t, but because we\u2019re hopeful about what can happen if we\u00a0do.</p>\n<p>Over the last couple of months, we\u2019ve seen what it looks like when a society loses the ability to distinguish truth from fiction. Mike McFaul and I were talking backstage, and my first time in Moscow as president, we gathered with all these civic activists. Putin at that time had receded from the foreground, and you had all these folks who are working to make Russia better. And we were reminiscing and thinking about that moment of possibility and what might have happened to\u00a0him.</p>\n<p>And now, in Russia, those who control the information have led public opinion further and further and further and further away from the facts, until all of a sudden, almost a quarter of the country\u2019s combat power has been damaged or destroyed in what the government is claiming is a, quote, special military operation. That\u2019s what happens when societies lose track of what is\u00a0true.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the last couple of months have also shown what can happen when the world pushes back. We have seen it in the people, including some of our Obama leaders in Europe who are organizing on social media to help Ukrainian refugees, offering food and shelter and jobs and rides. We\u2019ve seen IT in an army of volunteers who work to break through Russia propaganda and reach out to mothers of Russian soldiers, asking them to call on Putin to bring their sons home. And we\u2019ve seen it in the combination of old and new media like a viral image of a Russian TV editor walking into a live shot with a handwritten sign, calling for an end to the\u00a0war.</p>\n<p>The handwritten sign was a tool. TV\u2019s a tool. The Internet is a tool. Social media is a tool. At the end of the day, tools don\u2019t control us. We control them, and we can remake them. It\u2019s up to each of us to decide what we value, and then use the tools we\u2019ve been given to advance those values. And I believe we should use every tool at our disposal to secure our greatest gift, a government of, by, for the people for generations to come. And I hope you agree with me, and I look forward to you joining in the\u00a0work.</p>\n<p>Thank you very much, everybody.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=7d7af7ba28af\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n","enclosure":{},"categories":[]}]}
