Yes? (Laughter.) Okay. There we\u00a0go.</p>\n<p><em>(The portraits are unveiled.) </em>(Applause.)</p>\n<p>Thank you so much. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you! Thank you so\u00a0much.</p>\n<p>Please, everybody have a seat. Have a seat. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Sit down, everybody. Thank you very\u00a0much.</p>\n<p>It is great to be back. President and Dr. Biden, Vice President Harris and Second Gentleman Emhoff, thank you so much for your hospitality. Thanks for letting us invite a few friends to the White House. We will try not to tear up the\u00a0place.</p>\n<p>Someone\u200a\u2014\u200asomeone once said that if you\u2019re looking for a friend in Washington, get a dog. Our family was lucky enough to have two wonderful dogs. But I was even luckier to have a chance to spend eight years working day and night with a man who became a true partner and a true\u00a0friend.</p>\n<p>Joe, it is now America\u2019s good fortune to have you as President. You have guided us through some perilous times. You\u2019ve built on and gone beyond the work we all did together to expand healthcare, to fight climate change, to advance social justice, and to promote economic fairness.</p>\n<p>Thanks to your decency and thanks to your strength\u200a\u2014\u200amaybe most of all thanks to your faith in our democracy and the American people\u200a\u2014\u200athe country is better off than when you took office, and we should all be deeply grateful for that. So, thank you so\u00a0much.</p>\n<p>To all the former Obama-Biden staffers who are here in person, some of you are watching at home, thank you for being a part of this. When people ask me what I miss most about the White House years, it is not Air Force One that I talk about. Although, I miss Air Force One. It is the chance that I had to stand shoulder to shoulder with all of you; to have a chance to witness so many talented, selfless, idealistic, good people working tirelessly every day to make the world\u00a0better.</p>\n<p>And for eight years, and even longer for some of you, I drew on your energy and your dedication and your goodness. You inspired me, and I never wanted to disappoint you. And I tried to reflect the same heart and character that you displayed every day. Even during the toughest times, it was all of you that kept me going. So, it\u2019s good to be back to have a chance to see all of you and to, once again, say thank\u00a0you.</p>\n<p>Now, as much as I miss our work together, what\u2019s been a special joy is to see what\u2019s happened since because so many of you are doing amazing things, whether it\u2019s in government, in the private sector, in academia, or non-profits.</p>\n<p>And I\u2019m especially glad to see so many of you serving President Biden as well as you served me\u200a\u2014\u200aalthough now some of you who, let\u2019s face it, you were kids back then, are now in charge and running the show\u2014 which is a little shocking\u200a\u2014\u200aand may also explain some of the grey hairs I\u2019m seeing on some of\u00a0you.</p>\n<p>But it validates what I had always hoped, which was that our time together would only be the beginning of incredibly impactful careers.</p>\n<p>And some of you who\u2019ve I\u2019ve had a chance to stay in touch with, I\u2019m thrilled to see that you\u2019ve started families of your own. I am a little disappointed that I haven\u2019t heard of anyone naming a kid \u201cBarack\u201d\u00a0yet.</p>\n<p>FIRST LADY OBAMA: Or Michelle.</p>\n<p>PRESIDENT OBAMA: Or Michelle. But there is still\u00a0time.</p>\n<p>Finally, I want to say a special thanks to the White House staff. We had a chance to see them all beforehand. You took incredible care of our family for eight years. And along the way, you became a part of it. And we have not ever forgotten the kindness that you showed\u00a0us.</p>\n<p>Now, when Michelle and I had our portraits unveiled at the National Portrait Gallery a few years back, I said that, as far as I could tell, no one in my family tree had ever sat for a portrait before. I certainly had not. And now, all of a sudden, we\u2019ve done it\u00a0twice.</p>\n<p>But these portraits today have a special significance, because, as Joe mentioned, they will hang in the White House alongside portraits of other Presidents and First Ladies dating back to George and Martha. So, it was important to find the right people to paint\u00a0them.</p>\n<p>I want to thank Sharon Sprung for capturing everything I love about Michelle\u200a\u2014\u200aher grace, her intelligence, and the fact that she\u2019s fine. I\u2019m just saying. She is. Her portrait is stunning.</p>\n<p>And I want to thank Robert McCurdy for taking on a much more difficult subject\u200a\u2014\u200aand doing a fantastic job with\u00a0mine.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*owEywm9J3y5lewfSVV20LQ.jpeg\"><figcaption>Portrait by Robert\u00a0McCurdy</figcaption></figure><p>Robert is known for his paintings of public figures\u200a\u2014\u200aToni Morrison, the Dalai Lama, Nelson Mandela, Muhammad Ali. But what I love about Robert\u2019s work is that he paints people exactly the way they are, for better or worse. He captures every wrinkle on your face, every crease in your\u00a0shirt.</p>\n<p>You\u2019ll note that he refused to hide any of my grey hairs. Refused my request to make my ears\u00a0smaller.</p>\n<p>He also talked me out of wearing a tan suit, by the way. (Laughter and applause.) So\u200a\u2014\u200a(laughs). (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>His work is so precise that, at first glance, it looks like a photograph. And Robert also paints his subjects looking straight ahead, so it feels like you\u2019re face-to-face, forming a connection.</p>\n<p>And that appealed to me, in part because Presidents so often get airbrushed. They even take on a mythical status, especially after you\u2019ve gone and people forget all the stuff they didn\u2019t like about\u00a0you.</p>\n<p>But what you realize when you\u2019re sitting behind that desk, and what I want people to remember about Michelle and me, is that Presidents and First Ladies are human beings like everyone else. We have our gifts. We have our flaws. You\u2019ve all experienced mine. We have good days and bad days. We feel the same joy and sadness, frustration and\u00a0hope.</p>\n<p>And while it takes a certain amount of self-confidence to be President, there are nights where we lie awake wondering if this or that decision was the right\u00a0one.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve always described the presidency as a relay race. You take the baton from someone, you run your leg as hard and as well as you can, and then you hand it off to someone else, knowing that your work will be incomplete. The portraits hanging in the White House chronicle the runners in that race\u200a\u2014\u200aeach of us tasked with trying to bring the country we love closer to its highest aspirations.</p>\n<p>And when future generations walk these halls and look up at these portraits, I hope they get a better, honest sense of who Michelle and I were.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, guys. Okay, thank you, everybody.</p>\n<p>Oh, well, let me thank my husband, first of all, for such spicy\u00a0remarks.</p>\n<p>PRESIDENT OBAMA: I\u2019m not running\u00a0again!</p>\n<p>FIRST LADY OBAMA: And, of course, thank you Joe and Jill, President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden. Thank you for inviting us back. This means so much to\u00a0us.</p>\n<p>We were saying at lunch that the girls have lived in this house longer than they\u2019ve lived anywhere. And so this, as odd of a home as this can be, as wonderful it can\u200a\u2014\u200aas it can be\u200a\u2014\u200ait is a\u200a\u2014\u200ait is a special place because we raised our girls here. And it means so much to come back to friends and to be able to spend time talking about our\u00a0girls.</p>\n<p>And so, I am grateful to both of you for the work that you\u2019re doing; the love that you\u2019re showing us, our staff; and the work that you\u2019re doing for this country. Thank you so\u00a0much.</p>\n<p>And, of course, to Vice President Harris and\u200a\u2014\u200aI love to say this\u200a\u2014\u200aSecond Gentleman Emhoff. Let\u2019s say it again: Second Gentleman. You\u2019re doing a great job. Thank you for joining us\u00a0today.</p>\n<p>And I can\u2019t go any further without, of course, acknowledging all of the amazing staff\u200a\u2014\u200afriends. It\u2019s\u200a\u2014\u200ayou\u2019re more than staff. You\u2019re friends. You\u2019re family to us, particularly the people who have been a part of my team over the\u00a0years.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t have time to name everyone, thank goodness. But you all knew\u200a\u2014\u200aknow who you are, from the campaign, to the White House, to today. I would not be who I am without your passion and your faith, and all of the love that you poured into everything that we accomplished together. And it was amazing\u200a\u2014\u200ahistoric.</p>\n<p>What did Sam Kass used to\u00a0say?</p>\n<p>AUDIENCE MEMBER: Unprecedented!</p>\n<p>FIRST LADY OBAMA: Unprecedented.</p>\n<p>You all mean the world to me. And I mean that from the bottom of my heart. So, thank you. Proud of you. Proud of the work that you\u2019ve done. Proud of what you\u2019re\u00a0doing.</p>\n<p>I also want to take the time to recognize the Residence staff. As Barack said, you guys made this a home. We snatched up a few of you all and took you with us. But for those of you who we couldn\u2019t bring, we miss you so much. We miss you so much. The best part about this house was you all. So, it\u2019s so good to see you. And you all look good\u200a\u2014\u200aso\u00a0good.</p>\n<p>I\u2019d also like to recognize Stewart McLaurin; of course, John Rogers. It\u2019s been amazing working you all over the\u00a0years.</p>\n<p>I have to recognize Bill Allman, who has been fabulous to work with over the\u00a0years.</p>\n<p>And of course, Thelma Golden and my dear friend Michael Smith for their\u200a\u2014\u200awe are where we are because of their comprehensive and rigorous work to identify these incredible artists.</p>\n<p>And that brings me to our artist. Of course, Robert McCurdy, who\u200a\u2014\u200ayou know, you did a good job. (Laughter.) You did a good\u00a0job.</p>\n<p>But I got to spend a lot of time Sharon Sprung. And Sharon now joins a small but mighty group of women who\u2019ve painted an official portrait here at the White House. (Applause.)</p>\n<p>And I\u2019m thrilled that this extraordinary work is going to be enshrined forever as part of our nation\u2019s\u00a0history.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*SP-H7vJ4j2uqoP0olzqlfQ.jpeg\"><figcaption>Portrait by Sharon\u00a0Sprung</figcaption></figure><p>But, Sharon, it was wonderful to work with you. You are a true spirit; that\u2019s one of the reasons why we connected. Your work is phenomenal, but it was your essence, your soul, the way you saw me, the way we interacted\u200a\u2014\u200aand it shows in this beautiful work.</p>\n<p>So, thank you for your brilliance, your artistry, and your patience\u2014 in this\u00a0process.</p>\n<p>I remember I went to see the work in Brooklyn. And poor Sharon, because no one is supposed to know who the artists are. So, her studio is her home. And so, she had this piece in her home. You couldn\u2019t have guests over. You were frightened that it would get out. You just wanted it out of your space. And every year, I thought about, she must be going\u00a0crazy.</p>\n<p>So, thank you. Thank you so much. Let\u2019s give them both a round of applause. (Applause.)</p>\n<p>Oh, believe it or not, it is still a bit odd for me to stand in this historic space, see this big, beautiful painting staring back at me. Growing up on Euclid Avenue, Mommy, I never could have imagined that any of this would be part of my\u00a0story.</p>\n<p>But even if it\u2019s all still a bit awkward for me, I do recognize why moments like these are important, why all of this is absolutely necessary. Traditions like this matter not just for those of us who hold these positions, but for everyone participating in and watching our democracy.</p>\n<p>You see, the people\u200a\u2014\u200athey make their voices heard with their vote. We hold an inauguration to ensure a peaceful transition of power. Those of us lucky enough to serve work, as Barack said, as hard as we can for as long as we can, as long as the people choose to keep us here. And once our time is up, we move\u00a0on.</p>\n<p>And all that remains in this hallowed place are our good efforts and these portraits\u200a\u2014\u200aportraits that connect our history to the present day, portraits that hang here as history continues to be\u00a0made.</p>\n<p>So, for me, this day is not just about what has happened. It\u2019s also about what could\u00a0happen.</p>\n<p>Because a girl like me, she was never supposed to be up there next to Jacqueline Kennedy and Dolley Madison. She was never supposed to live in this house, and she definitely wasn\u2019t supposed to serve as First\u00a0Lady.</p>\n<p>AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you, Michelle!</p>\n<p>FIRST LADY OBAMA: Love you\u00a0back.</p>\n<p>But I\u2019ve always wondered: Where does that \u201csupposed to\u201d come from? Who determines it?</p>\n<p>And too often in this country, people feel like they have to look a certain way or act a certain way to fit in, that they have to make a lot of money or come from a certain group or class or faith in order to\u00a0matter.</p>\n<p>But what we\u2019re looking at today\u200a\u2014\u200aa portrait of a biracial kid with an unusual name\u200a\u2014\u200aand the daughter of a water pump operator and a stay-at-home mom\u200a\u2014\u200awhat we are seeing is a reminder that there\u2019s a place for everyone in this\u00a0country.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*U5oN0-NkU4ppa-Jw4GmZ1Q.jpeg\"><figcaption>Photo by Pete\u00a0Souza</figcaption></figure><p>Because as Barack said, if the two of us can end up on the walls of the most famous address in the world, then, again, it is so important for every young kid who is doubting themselves to believe that they can,\u00a0too.</p>\n<p>That is what this country is about. It\u2019s not about blood or pedigree or wealth. It\u2019s a place where everyone should have a fair shot, whether you\u2019re a kid taking two buses and a train just to get to school; or a single mother who is working two jobs to put some food on the table; or an immigrant just arriving, getting your first apartment, forging a future for yourself in a place you dreamed\u00a0of.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s why, for me, this day isn\u2019t about me or Barack. It\u2019s not even about these beautiful paintings. It\u2019s about telling that fuller story\u200a\u2014\u200aa story that includes every single American in every single corner of this country so that our kids and grandkids can see something more for themselves.</p>\n<p>And as much as some folks might want us to believe that that story has lost some of its shine, that division and discrimination and everything else might have dimmed its light, I still know deep in my heart that what we share\u200a\u2014\u200aas my husband continues to say\u200a\u2014\u200ais so much bigger than what we don\u2019t. Our democracy is so much stronger than our differences.</p>\n<p>And this little girl from the South Side is blessed beyond measure to have felt the truth of that fuller story throughout her entire life, never more so than\u00a0today.</p>\n<p>So, thank you to President Biden, to Sharon, and to all of you today for playing a part in this day and all the days that led to\u00a0it.</p>\n<p>And now, it is my privilege to introduce someone who is stepping in shoes and doing it well, someone who has devoted so much of her life to education, working to broaden the idea of whose story\u00a0matters.</p>\n<p>Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome my friend, First Lady Dr. Jill\u00a0Biden.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ec3096d4f3fd\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n","content":"\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vE2MBg2Qtfs-GOTtZryd_A.jpeg\"><figcaption>Photo by Pete\u00a0Souza</figcaption></figure><p><strong><em>Remarks as delivered in The White House East Room with President Biden and First Lady Dr. Biden.

Thank you so\u00a0much.</p>\n<p>Please, everybody have a seat. Have a seat. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Sit down, everybody. Thank you very\u00a0much.</p>\n<p>It is great to be back. President and Dr. Biden, Vice President Harris and Second Gentleman Emhoff, thank you so much for your hospitality. Thanks for letting us invite a few friends to the White House. We will try not to tear up the\u00a0place.</p>\n<p>Someone\u200a\u2014\u200asomeone once said that if you\u2019re looking for a friend in Washington, get a dog. Our family was lucky enough to have two wonderful dogs. But I was even luckier to have a chance to spend eight years working day and night with a man who became a true partner and a true\u00a0friend.</p>\n<p>Joe, it is now America\u2019s good fortune to have you as President. You have guided us through some perilous times. You\u2019ve built on and gone beyond the work we all did together to expand healthcare, to fight climate change, to advance social justice, and to promote economic fairness.</p>\n<p>Thanks to your decency and thanks to your strength\u200a\u2014\u200amaybe most of all thanks to your faith in our democracy and the American people\u200a\u2014\u200athe country is better off than when you took office, and we should all be deeply grateful for that. So, thank you so\u00a0much.</p>\n<p>To all the former Obama-Biden staffers who are here in person, some of you are watching at home, thank you for being a part of this. When people ask me what I miss most about the White House years, it is not Air Force One that I talk about. Although, I miss Air Force One. It is the chance that I had to stand shoulder to shoulder with all of you; to have a chance to witness so many talented, selfless, idealistic, good people working tirelessly every day to make the world\u00a0better.</p>\n<p>And for eight years, and even longer for some of you, I drew on your energy and your dedication and your goodness. You inspired me, and I never wanted to disappoint you. And I tried to reflect the same heart and character that you displayed every day. Even during the toughest times, it was all of you that kept me going. So, it\u2019s good to be back to have a chance to see all of you and to, once again, say thank\u00a0you.</p>\n<p>Now, as much as I miss our work together, what\u2019s been a special joy is to see what\u2019s happened since because so many of you are doing amazing things, whether it\u2019s in government, in the private sector, in academia, or non-profits.</p>\n<p>And I\u2019m especially glad to see so many of you serving President Biden as well as you served me\u200a\u2014\u200aalthough now some of you who, let\u2019s face it, you were kids back then, are now in charge and running the show\u2014 which is a little shocking\u200a\u2014\u200aand may also explain some of the grey hairs I\u2019m seeing on some of\u00a0you.</p>\n<p>But it validates what I had always hoped, which was that our time together would only be the beginning of incredibly impactful careers.</p>\n<p>And some of you who\u2019ve I\u2019ve had a chance to stay in touch with, I\u2019m thrilled to see that you\u2019ve started families of your own. I am a little disappointed that I haven\u2019t heard of anyone naming a kid \u201cBarack\u201d\u00a0yet.</p>\n<p>FIRST LADY OBAMA: Or Michelle.</p>\n<p>PRESIDENT OBAMA: Or Michelle. But there is still\u00a0time.</p>\n<p>Finally, I want to say a special thanks to the White House staff. We had a chance to see them all beforehand. You took incredible care of our family for eight years. And along the way, you became a part of it. And we have not ever forgotten the kindness that you showed\u00a0us.</p>\n<p>Now, when Michelle and I had our portraits unveiled at the National Portrait Gallery a few years back, I said that, as far as I could tell, no one in my family tree had ever sat for a portrait before. I certainly had not. And now, all of a sudden, we\u2019ve done it\u00a0twice.</p>\n<p>But these portraits today have a special significance, because, as Joe mentioned, they will hang in the White House alongside portraits of other Presidents and First Ladies dating back to George and Martha. So, it was important to find the right people to paint\u00a0them.</p>\n<p>I want to thank Sharon Sprung for capturing everything I love about Michelle\u200a\u2014\u200aher grace, her intelligence, and the fact that she\u2019s fine. I\u2019m just saying. She is. Her portrait is stunning.</p>\n<p>And I want to thank Robert McCurdy for taking on a much more difficult subject\u200a\u2014\u200aand doing a fantastic job with\u00a0mine.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*owEywm9J3y5lewfSVV20LQ.jpeg\"><figcaption>Portrait by Robert\u00a0McCurdy</figcaption></figure><p>Robert is known for his paintings of public figures\u200a\u2014\u200aToni Morrison, the Dalai Lama, Nelson Mandela, Muhammad Ali. But what I love about Robert\u2019s work is that he paints people exactly the way they are, for better or worse. He captures every wrinkle on your face, every crease in your\u00a0shirt.</p>\n<p>You\u2019ll note that he refused to hide any of my grey hairs. Refused my request to make my ears\u00a0smaller.</p>\n<p>He also talked me out of wearing a tan suit, by the way. (Laughter and applause.) So\u200a\u2014\u200a(laughs). (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>His work is so precise that, at first glance, it looks like a photograph. And Robert also paints his subjects looking straight ahead, so it feels like you\u2019re face-to-face, forming a connection.</p>\n<p>And that appealed to me, in part because Presidents so often get airbrushed. They even take on a mythical status, especially after you\u2019ve gone and people forget all the stuff they didn\u2019t like about\u00a0you.</p>\n<p>But what you realize when you\u2019re sitting behind that desk, and what I want people to remember about Michelle and me, is that Presidents and First Ladies are human beings like everyone else. We have our gifts. We have our flaws. You\u2019ve all experienced mine. We have good days and bad days. We feel the same joy and sadness, frustration and\u00a0hope.</p>\n<p>And while it takes a certain amount of self-confidence to be President, there are nights where we lie awake wondering if this or that decision was the right\u00a0one.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve always described the presidency as a relay race. You take the baton from someone, you run your leg as hard and as well as you can, and then you hand it off to someone else, knowing that your work will be incomplete. The portraits hanging in the White House chronicle the runners in that race\u200a\u2014\u200aeach of us tasked with trying to bring the country we love closer to its highest aspirations.</p>\n<p>And when future generations walk these halls and look up at these portraits, I hope they get a better, honest sense of who Michelle and I were. And I hope they leave with a deeper understanding that if we could make it here, maybe they can too; they can do remarkable things\u00a0too.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-UjprUaGxENdFPEWrpmFOQ.jpeg\"><figcaption>Photo by Pete\u00a0Souza</figcaption></figure><p>Now, it is my pleasure to introduce someone who needs no introduction.

She was never supposed to live in this house, and she definitely wasn\u2019t supposed to serve as First\u00a0Lady.</p>\n<p>AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you, Michelle!</p>\n<p>FIRST LADY OBAMA: Love you\u00a0back.</p>\n<p>But I\u2019ve always wondered: Where does that \u201csupposed to\u201d come from? Who determines it?</p>\n<p>And too often in this country, people feel like they have to look a certain way or act a certain way to fit in, that they have to make a lot of money or come from a certain group or class or faith in order to\u00a0matter.</p>\n<p>But what we\u2019re looking at today\u200a\u2014\u200aa portrait of a biracial kid with an unusual name\u200a\u2014\u200aand the daughter of a water pump operator and a stay-at-home mom\u200a\u2014\u200awhat we are seeing is a reminder that there\u2019s a place for everyone in this\u00a0country.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*U5oN0-NkU4ppa-Jw4GmZ1Q.jpeg\"><figcaption>Photo by Pete\u00a0Souza</figcaption></figure><p>Because as Barack said, if the two of us can end up on the walls of the most famous address in the world, then, again, it is so important for every young kid who is doubting themselves to believe that they can,\u00a0too.</p>\n<p>That is what this country is about. It\u2019s not about blood or pedigree or wealth. It\u2019s a place where everyone should have a fair shot, whether you\u2019re a kid taking two buses and a train just to get to school; or a single mother who is working two jobs to put some food on the table; or an immigrant just arriving, getting your first apartment, forging a future for yourself in a place you dreamed\u00a0of.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s why, for me, this day isn\u2019t about me or Barack. It\u2019s not even about these beautiful paintings. It\u2019s about telling that fuller story\u200a\u2014\u200aa story that includes every single American in every single corner of this country so that our kids and grandkids can see something more for themselves.</p>\n<p>And as much as some folks might want us to believe that that story has lost some of its shine, that division and discrimination and everything else might have dimmed its light, I still know deep in my heart that what we share\u200a\u2014\u200aas my husband continues to say\u200a\u2014\u200ais so much bigger than what we don\u2019t. Our democracy is so much stronger than our differences.</p>\n<p>And this little girl from the South Side is blessed beyond measure to have felt the truth of that fuller story throughout her entire life, never more so than\u00a0today.</p>\n<p>So, thank you to President Biden, to Sharon, and to all of you today for playing a part in this day and all the days that led to\u00a0it.</p>\n<p>And now, it is my privilege to introduce someone who is stepping in shoes and doing it well, someone who has devoted so much of her life to education, working to broaden the idea of whose story\u00a0matters.</p>\n<p>Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome my friend, First Lady Dr. Jill\u00a0Biden.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ec3096d4f3fd\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n","enclosure":{},"categories":[]},{"title":"My 2022 Summer Lists","pubDate":"2022-07-26 19:02:21","link":"https://barackobama.medium.com/my-2022-summer-lists-264bc5ab1b0a?source=rss-9e422a605dc5------2","guid":"https://medium.com/p/264bc5ab1b0a","author":"Barack Obama","thumbnail":"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*36vHbH_u9n7r6MZ7ALM0Cw.png","description":"\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*36vHbH_u9n7r6MZ7ALM0Cw.png\"></figure><h3>Summer Reading\u00a0List</h3>\n<p>I\u2019ve read a couple of great books this year and wanted to share some of my favorites so far.

Amid congressional gridlock and decades of failure to address our broken immigration system, my administration took action to protect hundreds of thousands of young people who were American in every way but\u00a0one.</p>\n<p>These Dreamers came to this country very young, sometimes as infants, and did everything right. They studied hard, worked hard, and proved to their parents that the risk of coming to America had paid off. Many did not know they were undocumented until they applied to college or tried to enlist in the military. And not only did a piece of paper suddenly stand in the way of their aspirations, it added a threat of deportation to a country they might not know with a language they might not\u00a0speak.</p>\n<p>But rather than accepting defeat and living in fear, these Dreamers did the opposite: They publicly proclaimed their immigration status. They showed how much the American Dream meant to them, sharing their stories of hope and heartbreak. And they called on their elected officials to do something to fix the system. That\u2019s who I was thinking about when our administration made it possible for them to apply for work authorization and protection from deportation through Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). Instead of living in fear, DACA made it possible for these promising young Americans to continue to thrive in the only country they had ever called home. It lifted the shadow of deportation from people of extraordinary promise. And the results\u200a\u2014\u200afor them and for us all\u200a\u2014\u200acannot be\u00a0denied.</p>\n<p>The more than 800,000 people who have received DACA protection are now teachers, service members, business owners, doctors, and parents. They are our friends and neighbors. With the protection of DACA, they helped to close the gap in high school graduation rates between citizens and noncitizens by 40 percent, as one study found.

Amid congressional gridlock and decades of failure to address our broken immigration system, my administration took action to protect hundreds of thousands of young people who were American in every way but\u00a0one.</p>\n<p>These Dreamers came to this country very young, sometimes as infants, and did everything right. They studied hard, worked hard, and proved to their parents that the risk of coming to America had paid off. Many did not know they were undocumented until they applied to college or tried to enlist in the military. And not only did a piece of paper suddenly stand in the way of their aspirations, it added a threat of deportation to a country they might not know with a language they might not\u00a0speak.</p>\n<p>But rather than accepting defeat and living in fear, these Dreamers did the opposite: They publicly proclaimed their immigration status. They showed how much the American Dream meant to them, sharing their stories of hope and heartbreak. And they called on their elected officials to do something to fix the system. That\u2019s who I was thinking about when our administration made it possible for them to apply for work authorization and protection from deportation through Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). Instead of living in fear, DACA made it possible for these promising young Americans to continue to thrive in the only country they had ever called home. It lifted the shadow of deportation from people of extraordinary promise. And the results\u200a\u2014\u200afor them and for us all\u200a\u2014\u200acannot be\u00a0denied.</p>\n<p>The more than 800,000 people who have received DACA protection are now teachers, service members, business owners, doctors, and parents. They are our friends and neighbors. With the protection of DACA, they helped to close the gap in high school graduation rates between citizens and noncitizens by 40 percent, as one study found. More than 200,000 of them have served on the frontlines of our nation\u2019s COVID-19 response, working on behalf of their fellow Americans at great risk to themselves.

Thank you. Well, thank you, Sahra-Josephine, for that introduction, and the extraordinary work that you are doing. And I want to thank my old friend, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, for hosting me and our extraordinary Obama Foundation leaders here today. It is wonderful to see all of you and I\u2019m confident that there have been extraordinary discussions that have been taking place since this conference began.<br><br>As we meet, Ukraine obviously weighs heavily on our hearts and minds. We\u2019ve all witnessed the terrible suffering in a war that recalls Europe\u2019s darkest history. But we have also witnessed the Ukrainian peoples\u2019 heroic resistance to Russian aggression. They\u2019ve united to defend not just their sovereignty, but their democratic identity, and their actions have rallied much of the world behind the values of self-determination and human dignity. It\u2019s inspiring.<br><br>Because of the courage and because of this solidarity on display, Vladimir Putin is failing to achieve his aims inside of Ukraine and beyond. NATO has stepped up and has grown stronger. Finland and Sweden are seeking swift accession. Countries have welcomed displaced Ukrainians with open arms. Meanwhile, Russia is cut off from resources and revenue, and many of its best and brightest have left, a blow to its present, but also to its future.<br><br>So we should take heart from Ukrainian resolve and from renewed transatlantic solidarity, and I know that\u2019s been discussed at this conference. These are signs of hope amidst despair. But make no mistake: this war is far from over. The costs will continue to mount. The course of events, as Anders and I discussed before we came out, are hard to predict. And our support for Ukraine must remain strong, steadfast and sustained until this conflict reaches a resolution.<br><br>Now, while Ukraine properly commands our immediate attention, it\u2019s also important to recognize that Putin\u2019s lawlessness is not happening in isolation. As I\u2019m sure previous speakers have noted, on every continent, we are seeing democratic backsliding. On every continent, emboldened autocrats are ramping up oppression, they\u2019re targeting minority groups, they\u2019re often flouting international law. Just as disturbing, within democracies, populist appeals grounded in fear and bigotry and resentment, have elevated leaders who, once they\u2019re in office, have sought to systematically undermine democratic institutions and entrench themselves in power. In my own country, the forces that unleashed mob violence on our Capitol are still churning out misinformation and conspiracy theories.<br><br>For those of us who fervently believe in the ideals of democracy, the question is: How do we\u00a0respond?</p>\n<p>If nothing else, recent events should shake us out of complacency. There was a trend after the fall of the Berlin Wall, a sense that history was inevitably going to usher in a democratic world. Well, we\u2019ve been reminded that democratic practice, democracy is neither inevitable nor self-executing. Most of recorded history is a chronicle of violence, and ignorance, and conflict; of strong nations subjugating weak nations, of groups using tribe, or race, or gender, or religion to justify dominion over others, to grant land and territory and resources. Sometimes they do it just because they can. Democracy, by contrast, has for most of human history been the anomaly. And in a relatively small period of time, in fits and starts. Through revolution, struggle, and sacrifice, democracy took hold in a few places, and then began in fits and starts, to spread, elsewhere in the globe. That expansion has helped contain some of humanity\u2019s baser impulses. But those instincts, those impulses were never eliminated, nor were the old structures of privilege and exploitation that they produced.<br><br>So the point is, if we want democracy to flourish, we will have to fight for it, we will have to nurture it, we will have to demonstrate its value, again and again, in improving the lives of ordinary people. And we will also have to be willing to look squarely at the shortcomings of our own democracies, not the ideal, but the reality of our own democracies. Only then will we be able to tell a better story of what democracy can be, and must be, in this rapidly changing world.<br><br>Now, for some of us, certainly those attending this conference, particularly those of you with gray hair like me, the virtues of democracy may seem obvious. For those generations scarred by successive World Wars, it was clear where dictatorship and master race theories and religious intolerance, and rampant nationalism could lead, because we\u2019d seen it here in Europe and elsewhere in the world, with bombed out cities and broken lives, as many as sixty million dead worldwide during World War II, Auschwitz, Stalin\u2019s gulags. For the Allies who emerged victorious, the goal was to prevent a repeat of such tragic history. So they built institutions to check unbridled power and to protect civil society and to foster pluralism. And they realized, well, if we\u2019re going to fight this battle, maybe we have to fix some of the things in our own democracies and make them more representative, make our hypocrisy, the gap between our words and our deeds, less obvious. Internationally they erected a multilateral system to reinforce international norms, recognize universal rights, and encourage the peaceful resolution of disputes.<br><br>As imperfect as these institutions were, most people during this period understood, to paraphrase Churchill, that democracy beat the alternatives. Two cheers for democracy. The notion was that democracy might not prevent every foolish war, but it made them less likely. Democracy might not end poverty and racism, but it could make things better. And, in fact, progress was real. But it was also incomplete.<br><br>That was a long time ago. I\u2019m now 60, and it happened before I was around. Most of the people alive on the earth today don\u2019t have that as a reference point.<br><br>Today, abstract appeals about democracy won\u2019t persuade the jobless youth on the outskirts of Paris, may not persuade families in Northern England struggling to pay the bills, or the displaced workers in the former factory towns of the American Midwest. And they barely register with the hundreds of millions of people trapped in poverty around the world.<br><br>A few weeks ago, I met with some young leaders who\u2019d just completed one of our Obama Foundation programs. We were in New York City. One of the participants was a remarkable young African who built an organization that expands educational opportunities for underserved youth, and he asked me a question. He said, \u201cPresident Obama, how do I answer my peers who argue that democracy in our country has failed to deliver? Everywhere, we see corruption, poverty, a lack of progress, despite election after election. When my peers look at China,\u201d he said, \u201cthey see a model of orderly advancement and material improvement in peoples\u2019 lives. So even if it means restrictions on some freedoms, isn\u2019t that worth the trade-offs?\u201d<br><br>Instinctively, I pointed out that the same system in China that his friends were praising now had let millions die of starvation and produced the chaos of the Cultural Revolution. I told the young man that he was too young to remember what life was like in his own country, before democracy came, that there had been a brutal civil war that also resulted in the death of millions, chronic corruption and then strife under subsequent military regimes. So I told him, \u201cYou need to broaden your lens,\u201d and he listened politely. What was he going to do? Maybe he was even moved by my arguments, but you could tell he didn\u2019t think his peers would be, at least not until those arguments were accompanied by measurable changes in their lives, where they live, in the here and now, not by reference to what happened 30 or 40 or 50 years ago.<br><br>I\u2019m convinced some version of this conversation is taking place right now in every country and on every continent. I\u2019m also convinced that, for us to win that contest of ideas between those of us who believe in democracy and those who are convinced that older ways of doing business are better, in that contest of ideas, it won\u2019t be enough to just say what we\u2019re against. We have to describe clearly what we are for. It won\u2019t be enough to reaffirm a creaky status quo, to just put a new coat of paint on the existing order, because the fact is, that order has been shaken at its foundations by globalization, financial crisis and social media, by rising inequality and mass migration, and climate change and a multi-polar world. If we are going to fortify democracy, if democracy is going to thrive and not just survive in a few pockets on the map, we are going to have to rebuild our democracies and our institutions, so they work better for more people for this new age.<br><br>Now, I\u2019m not here to offer a ten-point plan. I\u2019m no longer running for office. (Laughter.) Also, I don\u2019t have all the answers. Mainly I\u2019m not here to offer a ten-point place because I want you to hear from some of the young leaders we work with. (Cheers, applause.) This is their friends and support group. (Laughter.) I thought we were going to drink later. (Laughter.) Did you guys get an early start? (Laughter.) What I do want to do, though, before I bring them out, is I want to just spend a few minutes sketching, in very broad strokes, some of the work that I believe lies ahead.<br><br>To begin with, we need to be clear that democracy is about more than elections. Most of us understand this, but I think we really have to continually focus in on this because we have seen, time and again, how the machinery of elections can be twisted to serve the interests of despots.<br><br>I believe a genuine democracy must be rooted in the core principle that all persons, regardless of their race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, physical capacity, economic status\u200a\u2014\u200aall persons have an inviolable dignity and worth, and that they are entitled to a say in how they are governed and deserve equal treatment in the eyes of the law. That to me is a core principle of democracy. (Applause.)<br><br>There was a time\u200a\u2014\u200aand the reason that it\u2019s important for us to say this is because there was as time, a long time\u200a\u2014\u200awhen countries could claim to be model democracies, despite the fact that they maintained effective caste systems, racial caste systems, religious caste systems, gender caste systems. They treated people differently, but they said, \u201cOh, we\u2019re model democracies.\u201d<br><br>No more. No democracy is perfect, and injustice is embedded in every society, we can acknowledge that, but any system of government that calls itself a democracy, while codifying injustice, violates the very essence of the word.<br><br>That\u2019s a core principle at the center of the democratic project, and this core principle has to be operationalized, yes, through free and fair elections, but also through institutions that guarantee basic rights like the freedom of speech and assembly and the ability to practice one\u2019s faith.<br><br>It needs institutions that ensure the equal administration of justice and promote transparency and establish a process to resolve differences and transfer power peacefully. That\u2019s what we mean by true democracy, a system in which \u201cWe the People\u201d includes all, and not just some, citizens. Now, within that, the particulars of any nation\u2019s constitution, political process, administrative machinery may vary based on custom or tradition, but I believe that the pursuit of the deeper value must be our North Star.<br><br>By those standards, some democracies are doing better than others. Collectively, we\u2019re all falling short. To build stronger democracies and beat back this trend towards authoritarianism, we will all need to raise our game, and I\u2019d suggest we focus on four broad areas.<br><br>Number one, for democracy to flourish, we need to develop models for a more inclusive and sustainable capitalism.<br><br>I believe in market economies, not just because they\u2019re more efficient and more innovative than other systems, so far devised, but because, when properly structured, they\u2019re compatible with freedom. Scandinavian countries including Denmark demonstrate that.<br><br>But I also believe that the version of capitalism that has come to dominate the global economy has also come to corrode democracy. When you have trillions of dollars move around the globe, in the blink of an eye, outside the control of any sovereign country, far-flung mega companies operating beyond the reach of national regulation or oversight or tax collection, without regard for their impact on local communities or workers, and unconstrained by any values other than their quarterly shareholder report, that\u2019s a lot of power outside of democracy.<br><br>We have to acknowledge, economically, this globalization has made products cheaper, increased interdependence, it has helped drive rapid development in some countries, most notably China. But it has also driven income inequality to levels not seen in generations. In wealthy countries, it\u2019s amplified the loss of bargaining power for workers, it\u2019s stunted wage growth, it\u2019s reduced the status of workers, maybe for all but a narrow band of people in the knowledge professions.<br><br>For some poorer countries, the shift towards automation and relentless foreign competition has actually made it harder to develop viable local industry and expand a fledgling middle class, and there\u2019s been a constant brain drain of educated and skilled workers.<br><br>And while China has emerged as a big winner in the globalization sweepstakes, using export-driven strategies to lift a huge swath of its population out of poverty, it\u2019s come at the price of increased, steady repression and control of its people, and a more aggressive nationalism on the world stage, especially as growth slows and the Chinese government may find it harder to meet peoples\u2019 rising expectations.<br><br>Now, these aren\u2019t conditions where democracy is likely to thrive. When people feel economically insecure, when they feel the game is rigged, anger mounts, resentment builds. When democratic governments can\u2019t respond to these frustrations, partly because they don\u2019t have control, over the tax revenues or the regulatory capacity to deal with the major players in the economy, people grow cynical towards their leaders and the political system that produced them.<br><br>When the gap between rich and poor widens, further and further, then fellow citizens share fewer experiences. The rich people are behind the gate somewhere, and the poor people are outside, and their kids are not going to school together, and they\u2019re not feeling invested in each other. Well, people feel fewer obligations, and social trust declines.<br><br>And in the absence of solidarity, people are more likely to turn to populist appeals from strongmen who offer someone to blame, whether it\u2019s immigrants or minorities or foreign powers or shadowy elites or opposition parties or even democracy itself.<br><br>So if we want to strengthen our democracies, we have to pay attention to economics, and we need to make the global economy more responsive to workers, families, communities, and representative governments. Some of this work on labor protections or corporate governance, on tax policies that reduce inequality, and investment where it\u2019s needed, some of that will happen at a local or national level.<br><br>Other strategies, like ending global tax avoidance and combating kleptocracy, require international cooperation. But our objectives should be clear: reducing the wealth gap, expanding middle classes, restoring peoples\u2019 sense of control over their own livelihoods, making private companies more accountable. We want them to make a profit, but also more accountable for the common good. That\u2019s number one.<br><br>Number two, we need to revitalize our political institutions so that people believe that participation is worth the effort.<br><br>In too many democracies, politics feels like a distant and increasingly irrelevant enterprise. Some of that is by design, by the way. In my own country, for example, we have what\u2019s called a filibuster rule in the United States Senate that has effectively made it almost impossible for either party, even when they have a majority, to get anything substantial through the Senate and passed and signed into law.<br><br>At a certain point, people start wondering, why bother?<br><br>We have governments making it too hard to vote, a lot of governments who make it difficult to see why your vote matters. The powerful seem to have more access. They act with impunity. Over time, the people and their elected representatives break down.<br><br>So every democracy has to take basic steps to restore confidence that democracy is working the way it\u2019s supposed to, like protecting the right to vote, ensuring that vote is counted equally and transparently, holding the powerful to account when they bend the rules or break the law, ending the scourge of dark money that so often corrupts our politics.<br><br>More than that, democracies need to redesign governments so that they can deliver better results. In some cases, that means stripping away bureaucracy and red tape, even when it\u2019s well-intentioned, which makes government unable to move on major initiatives. In the United States right now, building infrastructure, like mass transit or road projects or an airport, it costs like two or three times more than it does here in Europe! And in some cases, it means pushing more decision-making to the local and regional level, so we can road test new ideas to solve problems and build bridges between those in power and the people that they\u2019re supposed to represent, an issue here in Europe that has to be paid attention to. The bottom line is that people care about democratic process, but they also want results.<br><br>Third, we need to spend more time and energy building a democratic culture.<br><br>Those of us who promote democracy, we\u2019re often progressive. We focus a lot on policy. We see politics and governance as pluralistic negotiation between competing rational, self-interested actors. That\u2019s not what moves people in the world. Emotions matter. Stories matter. People care about meaning and purpose and belonging and status. And in this age of uncertainty and polarization, we\u2019ve seen the loss of many of the stabilizing foundations in peoples\u2019 lives, whether its neighborhoods that are disrupted or religious, cultural or civic organizations that are atrophying. Often, it\u2019s authoritarian leaders who understand this, and those of us who believe in democracy struggle to catch up. We avoid what in the United States we call \u201cculture wars\u201d because we want to focus on tax policy. But those emotions are powerful and they\u2019re legitimate. Purpose, meaning, connection. Those things do matter.<br><br>Now, I want to be clear, I have little sympathy for reactionaries who cynically condemn identity politics or cancel culture when really all they\u2019re doing is trying to preserve existing privileges, or excuse entrenched injustice or bigotry. I mean, the original identity politics is racism and sexism and homophobia, and that\u2019s nothing if not identity politics, and it\u2019s done a lot more harm than some tweet from and aggrieved Liberal.<br><br>But what is also true is that, if we\u2019re going to strengthen democracy, if we want to encourage pluralism and civility and self-governance, we have to embrace and restore a language of mutual respect that speaks to peoples\u2019 need for belonging, that they care about the traditions they come from, they care about the places they come from. They want to feel proud about who they are. And that\u2019s easier to do in homogeneous countries; it\u2019s harder to do as countries become more diverse.<br><br>So my point is, a big part of strengthening democracy is not just about politics and policy; it is about culture. And we have to embrace that. We have to expand the civic education that we provide our children and give them practice to live in a democracy. We have to create organizations that give them experience in working with people who are different, and exercise their civic muscles. We need to create platforms that encourage a willingness that nudge people and incentivize people to extend good faith to those who are not like themselves, or don\u2019t think like themselves, a politics that is inclusive rather than exclusive. This is both ethically sound and a practical necessity, something that leaders Gandhi, and King, and Mandela understood. There\u2019s a reason why Nelson Mandela really focused on South African rugby, when he was released. He was sending a signal to those who had imprisoned him for 27 years, that I\u2019m not here to take away your traditions and your identity, as long as you make sure they are compatible with my dignity and respect for my people. (Applause.)<br><br>We need to find ways to build that kind of solidarity and forge connections with people, so that they don\u2019t push us away. That doesn\u2019t mean we have to indulge traditions that don\u2019t live up to our core principles of equality and human dignity, but it does mean that we need to use language that affirms the best of existing national, religious, and culture and ethnic traditions, rather than make arguments that make people feel like they have to abandon all aspects of their past. We can reckon with our darker histories without asking people to reject their own identities. Indeed, progress is about doing the work of perfecting our unions, not repudiating the possibility of a union.<br><br>Finally, as we do all these things, we have to take steps to detoxify our discourse, particularly the scourge of disinformation and conspiracy theories, and hate online that has polluted our political discourse.<br><br>Now, I spoke about at length about this at Stanford University, in the spring, but I\u2019ll just reinforce a few key points. Technology companies have to accept a degree of democratic oversight and accountability. Profit can\u2019t be the only driver for platforms who have acquired power once reserved for nation-states. And while no human endeavor can eliminate human fallibility, we can actually make these things better. These technologies and platforms were made by human beings; human beings can make them work better.<br><br>I look forward to doing more work in the months to come to lift up and put forth new ideas around technology and the other areas that I just mentioned, because these are the areas where we all have to do better. It\u2019s going to determine the fate of our democracies, whether they stick, whether they get stronger, or whether they continue to get weaker.<br><br>But, although I\u2019m ready to volunteer and sign up, and work with existing groups and organizations that are focused in these areas, I want to underscore\u200a\u2014\u200aI\u2019m probably not going to be the main driver of solutions at this stage, nor are many of us in this room, who already\u200a\u2014\u200aI won\u2019t say are passed our primes, but we have gone through\u200a\u2014\u200arun through positions of power. Because we need to build democracy for the future, not the past.<br><br>And what gives me hope is the promise and potential of the next generation of leaders who are coming up, young people who understand that the future of democracy, and in fact, the very planet that we live on, hangs in the balance. These young people are ready to do the work, and many of them are already deeply engaged in the project of rebuilding our democracies.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s who Michelle and I are supporting at our Foundation, and that is why I\u2019m so glad to be joined by just a small sampling of our extraordinary Obama Foundation leaders from all across Europe, who gathered here today. If you can all please welcome, Tudor, Federica and Selvije. Come on\u00a0up.</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/f1747082849d11f26f6f17f0643ac7ee/href\">https://medium.com/media/f1747082849d11f26f6f17f0643ac7ee/href</a><p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> First of all, you can tell what outstanding young leaders they are because they already know you want to bring your own fans to events. (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Before we start our conversation, I would love for each of you very briefly to describe for the audience who you are, what you\u2019ve been doing, and why it\u2019s been so exciting for you to gather with some of the other leaders and peers from across\u00a0Europe.</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI:</strong> First of all, thank you very much, Mr. President, for having us here and thanks to all the Obama leaders out there, because it\u2019s really nice getting an audience with you\u00a0guys.</p>\n<p>My name is Federica Vinci. I am the deputy mayor of Isernia, which is a small town in the south of Italy. The work that I do is basically to try to bring back politics, grassroots politics in a very small town in my region and hopefully, in the future, in my\u00a0country.</p>\n<p>The best part of being here with all these amazing leaders has been having the chance to reconnect with people that do our same job, even if different fields. Sometimes it feels lonely when you are on the ground trying to make change, but reconnecting with all of you has been such a gift, because it reminds us why we\u2019re here and what our purpose is. So thank you very\u00a0much.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> Excellent. (Applause.)</p>\n<p>Tudor?</p>\n<p><strong>TUDOR IULIAN BRADATAN:</strong> Thank you very much. I\u2019m Tudor. I\u2019m from Romania. I am the executive director of what we call an online digital campaigning organization. We work on multi-issues, ranging from the environment to the rule of law. We have an online community with 1.2 million members. This is the people that receive constantly our updates and are invited to take action whenever is needed. We put pressure on decision-makers each time there is a good opportunity.</p>\n<p>We fundraise from our members and this is how we manage to actually win campaigns. Sometimes we fundraise for expensive lawsuits. Sometimes we fundraise for ads in newspapers to get our message\u00a0across.</p>\n<p>I chose this work because it\u2019s my way of defending democracy and it\u2019s my way to help people, simple people from all walks of life to have a say in today\u2019s democracy basically.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> Excellent. (Applause.)</p>\n<p>Selvije?</p>\n<p><strong>SELVIJE MUSTAFI:</strong> Thank you so much. My name is Selvije Mustafi. I\u2019m coming from North Macedonia and I\u2019m national grassroots organizer within the biggest Roma national movement in Macedonia named Avaja, which means we are\u00a0coming.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been active for ten years now from the age of 16 and our movement\u2019s purpose is to build power in the communities and articulate Roma\u2019s issues on higher national\u00a0level.</p>\n<p>And another thing is now that from our movement, we also built another seven national movements in seven different countries, and I serve as trainer trying to build the communities, build the structures, and build\u00a0power.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> Fantastic. (Applause.)</p>\n<p>All right. So we only have about 40 minutes. I want to start with an open-ended question because in my opening remarks, I said that, certainly for my grandparents, my parents, and to some degree for me, when I think about democracy and the tension between democracy and authoritarianism, my reference point is the Cold War. I think about, you know, I was in law school when the Berlin Wall came down. I\u2019m trying to do the math as to whether you were born when the Berlin Wall came down. (Laughter.) I don\u2019t think so,\u00a0right?</p>\n<p>I\u2019m interested, when we\u2019re here at this democratic summit, how do you and your peers think about this issue of democracy in your own countries here in Europe, worldwide? Do you have a sense of concern and worry that democracy is declining? Do you feel cynical about how existing democracies operate?</p>\n<p>Obviously, it\u2019s hard to generalize for everybody your age, but you\u2019re also having a lot of conversations with people who are active and care about\u00a0issues.</p>\n<p>Federica, you want to\u00a0start?</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI:</strong> Being the deputy mayor of a small town, it means that I get to have a lot of meetings with people of my age, but also younger, 15 years old, 16, 18 years old, boys and girls. I remember right after that I was elected and nominated deputy mayor, I\u2019m also in charge of youth policies. Coming from a community organizing background, I decided to call all the representatives of the different high schools of my hometown. We sat around the table and I asked them, so guys, tell me, how have you worked with politicians in the past? What have you guys done together or what has been done for\u00a0you?</p>\n<p>And well, before asking this question, the first thing that they said to me was, have we done anything\u00a0wrong?</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> Why are you calling me in here? Am I in\u00a0trouble?</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI:</strong> Why are you calling us here? Are we in trouble? This made me realize that these guys and these girls had never been listened to\u00a0before.</p>\n<p>When we were talking about politics, they were completely disillusioned, not because\u200a\u2014\u200aand I thought because they didn\u2019t have any luck for the future or they didn\u2019t have any thought about their jobs. But actually they were not even thinking about their future. They had never been listened to. They had never been involved in policymaking. Politicians were doing policies without involving them at all. So they were like, we don\u2019t see politicians. We don\u2019t hear from them. We just see them when they want our\u00a0votes.</p>\n<p>And I think that if we want\u200a\u2014\u200aof course we want democracy, right? We want our rights to be protected. We want our freedom. I don\u2019t think that anybody would exchange democracy for anything in the world. Yet we have to admit that democracy, at least in places like mine, is failing generations, like my generation or generations even\u00a0younger.</p>\n<p>So we as politicians, as leaders have a huge responsibility to go back into these places and make these boys, these girls part of the solution, part of this policymaking process, listen to them and engage\u00a0them.</p>\n<p>Because we are talking about huge numbers. Like Italy has around 8,000 municipalities. 180 municipalities are above 50,000 people. All the rest, more than 7,800 municipalities are really small towns where politicians can have a day-to-day engagement with their constituencies and with those kids. I think it\u2019s our job to do it because this is the only way we can infuse hope in them and in the future of democracy.</p>\n<p>(Applause.)</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> As I listen, I\u2019m going to think of new questions, and I\u2019ll give you a new question, Tudor, but you can answer the old question. Take it where you want. But as I was listening to Federica speaking, she mentioned online. One thing we know about young people, whether in Europe, the United States, Africa, anywhere in the world, a larger portion of their time, attention is on the phone or a\u00a0screen.</p>\n<p>I know that you have worked in thinking about how to use these new technologies to engage people rather than isolate them. What strategies have worked for you when it comes to engaging people online? But how does that also then translate into action in the real world? Because we have an expression in the United States, \u201chashtag activism,\u201d where somebody just tweets like or has a sarcastic comment about something and then kind of feels like, well, there was my political activism for the day. (Laughter.) But it never actually translates into voting, mobilization, initiatives that bring about change. What\u2019s your\u00a0sense?</p>\n<p><strong>TUDOR IULIAN BRADATAN:</strong> I would rather answer with an example. In our world, we always say that e-mail is dead. It\u2019s difficult to reach people via e-mail. And it\u2019s a very good solution because unlike social media, the e-mail is targeted. You have an e-mail address, you send an e-mail, the person receives the e-mail. With social media, it\u2019s much more complicated than that. And with these new networks that arise, it\u2019s hard for us to even find ways in which we can actually tap in with our messaging.</p>\n<p>The example I\u2019m going to give you is with a petition that was started on our website by the students in Romania. They asked for a modernization of the way in which they\u2019re evaluated. They go through the same evaluation that I went through when I went to high school or my sister that is ten years older than me, and it wasn\u2019t\u00a0changed.</p>\n<p>What they did is they signed a petition on our website, 400,000 of them, almost every kid in school in Romania signed a petition. We require an e-mail when people signed that petition. They created that e-mail in order to sign the petition, and we want to work with them together for the next\u00a0steps.</p>\n<p>What happened with that petition? The first time that it was submitted to the Minister of Education, he kind of mocked them. But then they came up with follow-up tactics. The last declaration of the minister is somewhat, \u201cI\u2019m going to think about it,\u201d but already I see them win that campaign. Even if it\u2019s going to take a little bit more time, the way in which they work together, the way in which they are creative to put pressure on decision-makers makes me have much more hope than I have in my generation, for instance.</p>\n<p>I would not treat these kinds of things as individual, things that are too individualistic. We have to work together. The students in Romania, they somehow managed to find ways in which they talked. They used the platform that last time I heard of it, it was for online gaming, people synchronizing on strategies, and they used that software. It was impressive for me to see how well that can be organized and how efficient they are. That is the one thing that brings me a lot of\u00a0hope.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> Selvije, Federica works very local. And you, on the other hand, are part of a European-wide network advocating on behalf of the Roma people. What do you see, what are the trends that you\u2019re seeing in terms of young people getting involved Europe-wide and how do they feel about European democracy?</p>\n<p>Because one of the interesting things about democracy in Europe, I remember when I was president coming here, you had local governments, you had regional governments, you had national governments. Then you had Brussels. You\u2019ve got the EU. You\u2019ve got the European Parliament. There are a bunch of different ways to access politics. But I\u2019m wondering, does that make it more difficult or more accessible for people to want to get involved and to feel like they have a hand in who\u2019s making decisions that affect their\u00a0lives?</p>\n<p><strong>SELVIJE MUSTAFI:</strong> I\u2019m going to start with the following, that democracy has always meant the same. It has meant the voice of the people, the power of the people, the decision of the\u00a0people.</p>\n<p>And what I see in my generation and their perception and feeling of democracy has two aspects. The first one is that the Roma community, in their mid-twenties or even younger, they are very disappointed in democracy in general, also in the approach of how some political leaders are responding to democracy and democratic ideals.</p>\n<p>This has different reasons, because for so long, the Roma in general were excluded economically, politically, culturally, and were underrepresented. They didn\u2019t have their own representative who is coming directly from the community, who knows the issues in the community and the challenges, and who can deliver and articulate and try to solve them. Because representatives who are non-Roma, they cannot know what is happening in the Roma community better than the\u00a0Roma.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, working for ten years now in the community, building power in the community and showing different approaches, like relationship building and so on, the community and the young people see a different added value. They can participate in public dialogs with politicians, with different political actors, with mayors and so on, and they see that this is an element that gives them, how to say, that gives them a value where they can contribute.</p>\n<p>What is the narrative now in the community and among the youngsters? What I hear is, well, maybe we are, because we are the biggest ethnic minority in Europe with over 12 million Roma, maybe we are a key contributor to preserve democracy. And with all the painful, painful history and survivals that we had in the past, now we are still here and we are courageous and brave to take action. And that\u2019s what democracy is about, about bravery, an effort that will bring bigger\u00a0changes.</p>\n<p>(Cheers, applause.)</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> Excellent.</p>\n<p>All those people clapping up there, many of them are working on different issues. The three of you are working on different issues. One of the challenges for democracy in the United States is sometimes people become very narrow in the issues that they\u2019re concerned about. Climate change, that\u2019s a very complicated issue. Criminal justice reform is very detailed.</p>\n<p>Organizations, activists, even elected officials sometimes work narrowly, but in order to build power and actually move the levers of democracy, it\u2019s a huge advantage if you can form coalitions across\u00a0groups.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m wondering, how have you been thinking about in your own work or in conversations that you\u2019ve been having, the need to work across sectors or how do you think about the relationship between working in non-profits versus running for office? Always a difficult debate, I think, does change come more from the inside or from the outside, beating down the door? How have you been thinking about\u00a0that?</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI:</strong> We were just laughing because we were having this discussion 15 minutes\u00a0ago.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> Were you encouraging Tudor to run for something?</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI:</strong> Exactly, run for office,\u00a0yes.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> He\u2019s a very handsome guy. I think he could do\u00a0well.</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI:</strong> I\u2019m trying. I\u2019m trying really hard. But it\u2019s like he wants to be convinced.</p>\n<p>What I believe is that we need way more cross-sectional politics in general, but way more engagement in different sectors. Yes, there are tons of challenges. First of all, generally, as we were saying, activists do not want to run for office. This is what I\u2019m trying to change from the very bottom, because I believe that we have generally attached a very negative meaning to politics.</p>\n<p>While politics is the air we breathe, politics is in every single thing we do. It\u2019s in the transportations that we take, it\u2019s in the climate, it\u2019s in the way we engage with people, it\u2019s in the way we speak, how we are educated; politics is everything. So whenever someone tells me, \u201cOh, politics is bad, politics is corrupted, politics is full of scandals,\u201d I reply, \u201cThis is what governs your life.\u201d If this is what governs your life, do you really want to be governed by the worst people that you think are getting there? And we are electing them in democracies.</p>\n<p>So what I don\u2019t understand and what we were discussing about is that we talk a lot about democracy, but then especially in countries like mine, in places like mine, we have the lowest standards for the people that then get up in the parliament and write these laws for\u00a0us.</p>\n<p>I think that if we really want to change things, we need more people that have super-high moral standards and that want to change things from the grassroots to the top level to get engaged into politics and get elected. Because it\u2019s true that you can get an amazing amount of change as an activist.</p>\n<p>I was an activist before becoming a politician. I was a community organizer.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> Me, too. (Laughter, applause.)</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI:</strong> And I think I still want to be an activist. I want to be an activist. I want to get out and rally for climate change or I want to get out with my people and clean parks, if we need\u00a0to.</p>\n<p>But we cannot avoid thinking that politics is not part of the game. Politics is part of the game. Politics will always be part of the game. And if we don\u2019t think that we don\u2019t have to get engaged, then we will keep being governed by the people that we don\u2019t like, even though we vote for them. And then we have voter apathy and we have kids not going to vote and we have people getting way, way far away from politics, while this still governs our\u00a0life.</p>\n<p>This has to change and I am arguing that this needs to change from the very bottom where people like me, politicians, can start talking face to face with their constituency and regaining the trust that they\u2019ve lost so far because they have been governed by the wrong people, because the right one were just too scared of the bad environment that politics brings up\u00a0on.</p>\n<p>(Cheers, applause.)</p>\n<p><strong>TUDOR IULIAN BRADATAN:</strong> Almost convinced me, but no. I have resistance still.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> I\u2019m not going to put you on the spot today and ask you to announce your candidacy, but this goes to the issues of this summit. It\u2019s often easy to defend democracy in the abstract. But if you have been an activist and you\u2019ve been working from the outside, sometimes it is difficult to see why change is moving so slowly on the inside. As I said in my remarks, some of that is by\u00a0design.</p>\n<p>As somebody who started locally and then ended up running a pretty big government, a lot of the activists who worked with me would get frustrated and think somehow that, well, how come he hasn\u2019t gotten this done or that done yet? It must be because he no longer cares about us. He\u2019s talking to all these rich contributors and this and that. When, in fact, no, I still want exactly what you wanted, but the wheels of government are just moving very slowly because there are all these systems that are set up to block\u00a0it.</p>\n<p>The reason I say that is because I think for democracy to work, you have to have both. You have to have people who are in the engine room and the deck of the ship of democracy, working to make it move in the right direction, but you also have to have people on the outside who are constantly maintaining pressure and getting people involved, because that\u2019s the engine, that\u2019s the fuel that ultimately is going to get you to where you want to\u00a0go.</p>\n<p>And so, I\u2019m interested in how\u200a\u2014\u200aas I said, Tudor, you don\u2019t have to announce your candidacy.</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI:</strong> Not\u00a0yet.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> Because there is an important role to play in citizen participation, activism, organization. And so far, that\u2019s the role you\u2019ve chosen to play. Do you feel like you can make enough of a difference taking that approach, particularly if maybe sometimes you see\u200a\u2014\u200ayou said like the education minister seemed like he\u2019s not listening to 400,000 students. Do you think, \u201cyou know what, we should have somebody in there who does\u00a0listen?\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>TUDOR IULIAN BRADATAN:</strong> It\u2019s a big temptation for many activists to go into politics, and I admire those who do. It\u2019s not a matter of me thinking that politics is dirty and we should not touch it. No, politics is where decisions are\u00a0made.</p>\n<p>My fear is that, if people like me enter politics, we leave an empty spot in the civil society, and that supporting a country like Romania was difficult to fill in the first place. We are a young democracy. If all of us from the civil society turn into politics, we need to bring new people to form this new civil society. What I noticed in my line of work is that politicians become better when we demand them to do\u00a0so.</p>\n<p>Now, I think that in a way, the civil society is like that bad medicine that tastes bad, but you still need to take it because it makes you healthy. I like to be that medicine that tastes bad. It makes me feel better. (Laughter, applause.) But if I would get one single dollar each time I\u2019m invited to join politics, I would solve the funding for my organization for ten years. (Laughter.)</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> Let me start with you on this question, Selvije. We talked about online organizing, but one of the things that I do think has changed, even since I was in office, was the amount of misinformation, the difficulty of sorting between what\u2019s true and what\u2019s false, what\u2019s journalism and what\u2019s fabrication.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m wondering how all of you in the work that you try to do have dealt with the misinformation problem, whether it affects your work and whether you\u2019ve come up with some solutions, so that you can get facts and information out to people and you don\u2019t have to spend all your time refuting things that people think that aren\u2019t true, and in some cases politicize issues that shouldn\u2019t be political.</p>\n<p>In the United States, as I think many of you saw, COVID became somehow a political issue and getting vaccinated or wearing masks. A lot of that was driven just by misinformation that was out there, and that seems to be happening on more and more issues. I\u2019m wondering how it\u2019s affected you and whether you\u2019ve seen some solutions to help young people distinguish between what\u2019s true and false in making decisions about how to participate and what to\u00a0support.</p>\n<p><strong>SELVIJE MUSTAFI:</strong> Yes, definitely digital, the digital space has fundamentally altered on how people are being exposed to engage with information. And I think that the internet has enabled a lot of people to create and expand different kinds of content by a large audience at marginal costs, and it\u2019s instantly and freely accessible.</p>\n<p>However, there are big concerns also in our movement about how false information and misinformation is spreading on the internet to influence decisions by some political actors or political sides. So using the social media, you can create, and you can expand different kinds of misinformation.</p>\n<p>And as you said, the challenge is that those kind of fake news and misinformation are making the people to have a different kind of opinion, which is not necessarily relevant or truthful. And this is an issue we have also with the Roma community, a community who has been discriminated for so long, ignored. It\u2019s very easy. There is a big base to spread fake news and to make them think like that, and not necessarily they can now differentiate what is opinion and what is\u00a0fact.</p>\n<p>So what we do as activists, as movements, and\u200a\u2014\u200aI mean, what we what we can\u2019t do is we cannot\u200a\u2014\u200awe don\u2019t have the space and tools how to regulate the internet, but what we can do is to try to counteract this kind of false news and to try to actively produce content that is relevant and spread the frequency of our own message and our own narrative.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA: </strong>Excellent. Frederica, as an elected officials and activist, is that a problem that you\u2019ve seen in terms of the work that you\u2019re doing? Do you find you make a proposal, and somebody says, \u201cWell, you know, I just saw on the internet that what you\u2019re doing is going to cause cancer,\u201d or it\u2019s going to, you know, destroy the economy or something? And then you have to spend a lot of time unwinding some of\u00a0this?</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI: </strong>Yeah, and exactly, words like this. I really\u200a\u2014\u200alike a simple example, the cost of energy and the cost of water, they rose because of the war, yet we had a couple of newspapers saying that, since\u200a\u2014\u200athat we were getting paid by the taxpayer money of this increase in water and\u00a0energy.</p>\n<p>So it obviously is false, and it obviously should be easier to think about it, because it\u2019s like the war, and it\u2019s something way above us. Yet, what comes out there, and even what I notice is that it\u2019s even easier for people to get out this false news and this false noise, and it\u2019s\u00a0scary.</p>\n<p>So, and it\u2019s not just about that. It\u2019s about rumors that get out. It\u2019s about voices, rumors, like people talking to people. So in a very small town, you have a huge amount of rumors coming out, and our question was like, how do we counteract against it? What do we\u00a0do?</p>\n<p>So of course you can work online, but in such a small town, and again, Italy is full, and I guess also Europe, it\u2019s full of such small places. You can have a real confrontation with your constituencies.</p>\n<p>So we\u2019ve started having town halls in like open-air tunnels, and now that it\u2019s summer and COVID is not such a big risk, especially outside. And we\u2019ve asked people to join us in sharing with us their fears, their questions, what they want, how can we answer to their problems?</p>\n<p>And the first time, nobody asked questions. It was really weird, but then\u00a0\u2013</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA: </strong>Everybody just sat there for half-an-hour?</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI: </strong>Yeah, exactly, so we started talking about our policies, but then\u200a\u2014\u200ayeah, but then, on our policies, they started asking questions. And many of the were really good questions. We see a lot of anger on Facebook, a lot of anger on social media. And when you go in real life, first of all, this anger is not that bad, but second, it has a motive. It has a\u00a0reason.</p>\n<p>And when you meet your people and you can ask them, you can listen to them, you actually know what those reasons are, and you can give them answers. And not only, I think we should give them answers, but I think we should include them in the decision-making process and the implementation of the policies that we bring\u00a0about.</p>\n<p>So to counteract this fake news environment in the small town, I guess that the real solution is coming back on the ground, the grassroots, meeting with people, answering their questions, involving them and making them part of the changes that we want to see\u00a0around.</p>\n<p>(Applause.)</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA: </strong>Excellent. So we\u2019re coming to the end of our session here, and I want to give you a two-part question. If you ever decide to run for office, this is how reporters get around it. They\u2019re only supposed to get one question, that is, \u201cSir, I have a five-part question,\u201d and then they go and tick them off, and so I\u2019m going to use the trick they taught me. And you can answer both, either one, or just don\u2019t answer, which is also a strategy that I taught them. (Laughter.) And talk about what I want to talk\u00a0about.</p>\n<p>I opened with my remarks, and obviously an enormous amount of time has been spent at this summit, talking about the tragedy of what\u2019s happening in Ukraine. And I\u2019m wondering how you think this has affected you, your generation, to witness this kind of crisis in the heart of Europe in a way that harkens back to your grandparents\u2019 generation. It\u2019s been a long time since we saw that much violence, and now we can witness in real time and displacement. So I\u2019m curious how has it impacted you and your friends? How do you talk about it? And does it encourage you to see the response and make you more committed to the public work that you\u2019re doing? So that\u2019s one question.</p>\n<p>Part two, because we\u2019re running out of time, is what are the things that do inspire you and keep you going? Because I think, whether it\u2019s you Frederica or Tudor, but I know you all feel it, sometimes the work gets lonely. And sometimes democracy is discouraging. What is it that has kept that optimism and hope going even when you confront setbacks and when you feel like democracy\u2019s not working? So why don\u2019t we start then with\u00a0you.</p>\n<p><strong>SELVIJE MUSTAFI: </strong>Well, I think that the recent context and situation has affected generally the youth and in particular in the Roma community in many aspects, in many ways, psychologically, financially. And there is a lot of frustration.</p>\n<p>And as a matter of fact, in Ukraine, there are a lot of Roma. There is a big Roma community who has also been put aside and discriminated for so long. But yet again, the Roma who are there are fighting for Ukraine, and they are fighting for\u00a0freedom.</p>\n<p>So I hope the war ends as soon as possible. And I hope that after the war, Roma won\u2019t be forgotten.</p>\n<p>What really inspires me, because for so long the narrative towards us was negative. Many, much of stigma, negative perception, and big part of the Roma community accepted that. But going into the community, talking to people, working with people, and seeing how much of a big potential the Roma are, and how much of a big capacity we have, this is what really inspires me and drives\u00a0me.</p>\n<p>And this is something that I felt from the very beginning of my activism, 10 years ago, and I still feel it whenever I go to the community. And I think that this is the new generation of a driving change. And a community who can preserve democracy and who can be part of preserving democracy in the next period, and I hope, I really hope that Europe, European stakeholders and institutions will have more openness towards Roma and more inclusiveness in particular.</p>\n<p>(Applause.)</p>\n<p><strong>TUDOR IULIAN BRADATAN: </strong>When you asked me about\u200a\u2014\u200alike, how do I see democracy now, it made me realize that I\u2019m\u200a\u2014\u200ain my family, I\u2019m the first generation that lived their young years in peace and democracy. My parents, they lived theirs in the Cold War. My grandparents fought in World War II. My great-grandparents fought in World War\u00a0I.</p>\n<p>And so I am the first one, basically, that lived to see democracy. Now, I\u2019m not that young. I have gray hair. I still can hide it underneath the other parts. And I still remember the days in Romania when we were a dictatorship. I was very young, but there are things that still are very strong memories, the queues to go and buy food, the heaters that were cold in the\u00a0winter.</p>\n<p>I do not want to go back that. And for many years I thought that, for instance, war is something that is unthinkable, and after 2014, it became obvious that war is again a thing in Europe. And it scares me. And that\u2019s the reality. But that\u2019s what\u200a\u2014\u200aI mean, when we get paralyzed with fear, that\u2019s when they win. Fear is not really an option for us, because I do not want to go back to the days when Romania was a dictatorship. I do not want to see those atrocities happen\u00a0again.</p>\n<p>So I will fight with everything I have to keep the democracy going and make sure that this system, as imperfect as it is, keeps on going because it is the only thing that allows me to be in places like this to meet the amazing leaders that I met in the last few days. And meeting you is something that would have been unthinkable for my parents\u2019 generation.</p>\n<p>So we have to defend this because what would come next is unimaginable.</p>\n<p>(Applause.)</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA: </strong>Madam Mayor, you get the last word\u00a0here.</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI: </strong>When it comes to Ukraine, I still remember the day of the war, and I remember calling my friends in\u200a\u2014\u200aI mean, we were all shocked, and it was something that lasted for a while. Like we had that punch in the stomach. We couldn\u2019t think about what was happening. We couldn\u2019t think about the fact that we were\u200a\u2014\u200alike that our borders, like Ukraine, which we consider Europe, were at\u00a0war.</p>\n<p>And we are like a really big European generation, and so we felt extremely attacked, sad, lost, somehow. But on the other hand, it was also sort of a wake-up call, a reminder that, in Italy, at least in my town, and in my region, we are still lucky enough to be able to keep working on our democracy, that it\u2019s not working as we would like it to be. It\u2019s not being like we would like it to\u00a0be.</p>\n<p>So that, that brings me to the point of what is it that is passionate for me, and moves me, especially when you live in a town where, in front of you, you don\u2019t have just your political opponent, but probably the woman who stole your boyfriend when you were 15 years old and you still haven\u2019t forgotten.</p>\n<p>(Laughter.)</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA: </strong>That\u2019s a good point. I mean, that\u2019s\u200a\u2014\u200aif it\u2019s, you know, that makes it a little more personal.</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI:\u00a0</strong>Exactly.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA: </strong>You\u2019re, no\u200a\u2014\u200aI wasn\u2019t pointing. She\u2019s not here. I was pretending that I was pointing (laughter).</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI: </strong>But it gets harder because you want to do stuff, and you know that you can\u2019t move on because probably there is something personal behind it. So how do you do it? And this is also what gave me\u00a0hope.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll tell you, like a short story. I have been working with this woman\u200a\u2014\u200anot working, but I would have loved to have worked with this woman, but since I\u2019ve gotten elected, she\u2019s been opposing every single thing that I try to propose, from the football court for the kids, from a youth center, and with no reason, I couldn\u2019t understand why.</p>\n<p>So one day I went into the local high school to talk to the youth of the local high school, and I was talking to them about the fact that my mom wanted me to become a lawyer. My dad wanted me to become a consultant. I tried both, I hated them both. And then I got into politics, which was my\u00a0dream.</p>\n<p>And I told these kids that we live in a society that doesn\u2019t give us the space to understand who we are, what we love, and what we want to do. So it\u2019s their job and our job as politicians to support them in finding the space and allowing them to become what they\u00a0want.</p>\n<p>Great speech. I went back home, slept on it. The morning after, I receive a call. It was this woman, and she said, \u201cLook, my daughter was on the stage and was listening to you, and she filmed you, and she sent me the recording. And I wanted to thank you because my story is your story with the difference that I didn\u2019t have the courage that you had to follow my own dreams. And having you out there talking to my daughter about the fact that you did gave my daughter the confidence to come to me and say that she wanted to become an architect. So thank you very much. I\u2019m looking forward to work with you on this youth\u00a0center.\u201d</p>\n<p>(Applause.)</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA: </strong>That\u2019s\u00a0great.</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI: </strong>Knowing that, beyond being politicians, we are human beings that share stories, and at the end of the day, we all want this world to be a better place, that\u2019s what gives me hope, because I see, every single day, that we can overcome our differences. We can build bridges. We can close the gap between the politicians, the high school girls that had a fight over a boyfriend. And we can unite on what really matters for us. And this gives me a lot of\u00a0hope.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA: </strong>Good. Well, you\u200a\u2014\u200athe three of you give me hope. The young people who are working with us at the Foundation are giving us hope. For those of you who are already parts of organizations working on democratic issues, either here or on other continents, I cannot tell you enough that we have to invest in this cohort if we are going to succeed. Because every time I have a chance to have conversations, the kind of idealism and innovation and imagination and courage that you\u2019ve heard from these three, they\u2019re out there. And they need to be heard, and they need to be empowered, because they\u2019re going to be the ones who take us where we need to\u00a0go.</p>\n<p>All right. Please give them a big round of applause. Thank you, everybody. Thank\u00a0you.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=e9740dc78c5a\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n","content":"\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*qsgZfzUTqkYPyymgEPSbWg.jpeg\"></figure><p><em>Today, I spoke at the </em><a href=\"https://www.obama.org/copenhagen-2022/\"><em>Copenhagen Democracy Summit in Denmark</em></a><em> to discuss the importance of a positive vision for democracy, and the promise of the next generation to chart a better\u00a0course.</em></p>\n<p>Thank you. Thank you. Well, thank you, Sahra-Josephine, for that introduction, and the extraordinary work that you are doing. And I want to thank my old friend, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, for hosting me and our extraordinary Obama Foundation leaders here today. It is wonderful to see all of you and I\u2019m confident that there have been extraordinary discussions that have been taking place since this conference began.<br><br>As we meet, Ukraine obviously weighs heavily on our hearts and minds. We\u2019ve all witnessed the terrible suffering in a war that recalls Europe\u2019s darkest history. But we have also witnessed the Ukrainian peoples\u2019 heroic resistance to Russian aggression. They\u2019ve united to defend not just their sovereignty, but their democratic identity, and their actions have rallied much of the world behind the values of self-determination and human dignity. It\u2019s inspiring.<br><br>Because of the courage and because of this solidarity on display, Vladimir Putin is failing to achieve his aims inside of Ukraine and beyond. NATO has stepped up and has grown stronger. Finland and Sweden are seeking swift accession. Countries have welcomed displaced Ukrainians with open arms. Meanwhile, Russia is cut off from resources and revenue, and many of its best and brightest have left, a blow to its present, but also to its future.<br><br>So we should take heart from Ukrainian resolve and from renewed transatlantic solidarity, and I know that\u2019s been discussed at this conference. These are signs of hope amidst despair. But make no mistake: this war is far from over. The costs will continue to mount. The course of events, as Anders and I discussed before we came out, are hard to predict. And our support for Ukraine must remain strong, steadfast and sustained until this conflict reaches a resolution.<br><br>Now, while Ukraine properly commands our immediate attention, it\u2019s also important to recognize that Putin\u2019s lawlessness is not happening in isolation. As I\u2019m sure previous speakers have noted, on every continent, we are seeing democratic backsliding. On every continent, emboldened autocrats are ramping up oppression, they\u2019re targeting minority groups, they\u2019re often flouting international law. Just as disturbing, within democracies, populist appeals grounded in fear and bigotry and resentment, have elevated leaders who, once they\u2019re in office, have sought to systematically undermine democratic institutions and entrench themselves in power. In my own country, the forces that unleashed mob violence on our Capitol are still churning out misinformation and conspiracy theories.<br><br>For those of us who fervently believe in the ideals of democracy, the question is: How do we\u00a0respond?</p>\n<p>If nothing else, recent events should shake us out of complacency. There was a trend after the fall of the Berlin Wall, a sense that history was inevitably going to usher in a democratic world. Well, we\u2019ve been reminded that democratic practice, democracy is neither inevitable nor self-executing. Most of recorded history is a chronicle of violence, and ignorance, and conflict; of strong nations subjugating weak nations, of groups using tribe, or race, or gender, or religion to justify dominion over others, to grant land and territory and resources. Sometimes they do it just because they can. Democracy, by contrast, has for most of human history been the anomaly. And in a relatively small period of time, in fits and starts. Through revolution, struggle, and sacrifice, democracy took hold in a few places, and then began in fits and starts, to spread, elsewhere in the globe. That expansion has helped contain some of humanity\u2019s baser impulses. But those instincts, those impulses were never eliminated, nor were the old structures of privilege and exploitation that they produced.<br><br>So the point is, if we want democracy to flourish, we will have to fight for it, we will have to nurture it, we will have to demonstrate its value, again and again, in improving the lives of ordinary people. And we will also have to be willing to look squarely at the shortcomings of our own democracies, not the ideal, but the reality of our own democracies. Only then will we be able to tell a better story of what democracy can be, and must be, in this rapidly changing world.<br><br>Now, for some of us, certainly those attending this conference, particularly those of you with gray hair like me, the virtues of democracy may seem obvious. For those generations scarred by successive World Wars, it was clear where dictatorship and master race theories and religious intolerance, and rampant nationalism could lead, because we\u2019d seen it here in Europe and elsewhere in the world, with bombed out cities and broken lives, as many as sixty million dead worldwide during World War II, Auschwitz, Stalin\u2019s gulags. For the Allies who emerged victorious, the goal was to prevent a repeat of such tragic history. So they built institutions to check unbridled power and to protect civil society and to foster pluralism. And they realized, well, if we\u2019re going to fight this battle, maybe we have to fix some of the things in our own democracies and make them more representative, make our hypocrisy, the gap between our words and our deeds, less obvious. Internationally they erected a multilateral system to reinforce international norms, recognize universal rights, and encourage the peaceful resolution of disputes.<br><br>As imperfect as these institutions were, most people during this period understood, to paraphrase Churchill, that democracy beat the alternatives. Two cheers for democracy. The notion was that democracy might not prevent every foolish war, but it made them less likely. Democracy might not end poverty and racism, but it could make things better. And, in fact, progress was real. But it was also incomplete.<br><br>That was a long time ago. I\u2019m now 60, and it happened before I was around. Most of the people alive on the earth today don\u2019t have that as a reference point.<br><br>Today, abstract appeals about democracy won\u2019t persuade the jobless youth on the outskirts of Paris, may not persuade families in Northern England struggling to pay the bills, or the displaced workers in the former factory towns of the American Midwest. And they barely register with the hundreds of millions of people trapped in poverty around the world.<br><br>A few weeks ago, I met with some young leaders who\u2019d just completed one of our Obama Foundation programs. We were in New York City. One of the participants was a remarkable young African who built an organization that expands educational opportunities for underserved youth, and he asked me a question. He said, \u201cPresident Obama, how do I answer my peers who argue that democracy in our country has failed to deliver? Everywhere, we see corruption, poverty, a lack of progress, despite election after election. When my peers look at China,\u201d he said, \u201cthey see a model of orderly advancement and material improvement in peoples\u2019 lives. So even if it means restrictions on some freedoms, isn\u2019t that worth the trade-offs?\u201d<br><br>Instinctively, I pointed out that the same system in China that his friends were praising now had let millions die of starvation and produced the chaos of the Cultural Revolution. I told the young man that he was too young to remember what life was like in his own country, before democracy came, that there had been a brutal civil war that also resulted in the death of millions, chronic corruption and then strife under subsequent military regimes. So I told him, \u201cYou need to broaden your lens,\u201d and he listened politely. What was he going to do? Maybe he was even moved by my arguments, but you could tell he didn\u2019t think his peers would be, at least not until those arguments were accompanied by measurable changes in their lives, where they live, in the here and now, not by reference to what happened 30 or 40 or 50 years ago.<br><br>I\u2019m convinced some version of this conversation is taking place right now in every country and on every continent. I\u2019m also convinced that, for us to win that contest of ideas between those of us who believe in democracy and those who are convinced that older ways of doing business are better, in that contest of ideas, it won\u2019t be enough to just say what we\u2019re against. We have to describe clearly what we are for. It won\u2019t be enough to reaffirm a creaky status quo, to just put a new coat of paint on the existing order, because the fact is, that order has been shaken at its foundations by globalization, financial crisis and social media, by rising inequality and mass migration, and climate change and a multi-polar world. If we are going to fortify democracy, if democracy is going to thrive and not just survive in a few pockets on the map, we are going to have to rebuild our democracies and our institutions, so they work better for more people for this new age.<br><br>Now, I\u2019m not here to offer a ten-point plan. I\u2019m no longer running for office. (Laughter.) Also, I don\u2019t have all the answers. Mainly I\u2019m not here to offer a ten-point place because I want you to hear from some of the young leaders we work with. (Cheers, applause.) This is their friends and support group. (Laughter.) I thought we were going to drink later. (Laughter.) Did you guys get an early start? (Laughter.) What I do want to do, though, before I bring them out, is I want to just spend a few minutes sketching, in very broad strokes, some of the work that I believe lies ahead.<br><br>To begin with, we need to be clear that democracy is about more than elections. Most of us understand this, but I think we really have to continually focus in on this because we have seen, time and again, how the machinery of elections can be twisted to serve the interests of despots.<br><br>I believe a genuine democracy must be rooted in the core principle that all persons, regardless of their race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, physical capacity, economic status\u200a\u2014\u200aall persons have an inviolable dignity and worth, and that they are entitled to a say in how they are governed and deserve equal treatment in the eyes of the law. That to me is a core principle of democracy. (Applause.)<br><br>There was a time\u200a\u2014\u200aand the reason that it\u2019s important for us to say this is because there was as time, a long time\u200a\u2014\u200awhen countries could claim to be model democracies, despite the fact that they maintained effective caste systems, racial caste systems, religious caste systems, gender caste systems. They treated people differently, but they said, \u201cOh, we\u2019re model democracies.\u201d<br><br>No more. No democracy is perfect, and injustice is embedded in every society, we can acknowledge that, but any system of government that calls itself a democracy, while codifying injustice, violates the very essence of the word.<br><br>That\u2019s a core principle at the center of the democratic project, and this core principle has to be operationalized, yes, through free and fair elections, but also through institutions that guarantee basic rights like the freedom of speech and assembly and the ability to practice one\u2019s faith.<br><br>It needs institutions that ensure the equal administration of justice and promote transparency and establish a process to resolve differences and transfer power peacefully. That\u2019s what we mean by true democracy, a system in which \u201cWe the People\u201d includes all, and not just some, citizens. Now, within that, the particulars of any nation\u2019s constitution, political process, administrative machinery may vary based on custom or tradition, but I believe that the pursuit of the deeper value must be our North Star.<br><br>By those standards, some democracies are doing better than others. Collectively, we\u2019re all falling short. To build stronger democracies and beat back this trend towards authoritarianism, we will all need to raise our game, and I\u2019d suggest we focus on four broad areas.<br><br>Number one, for democracy to flourish, we need to develop models for a more inclusive and sustainable capitalism.<br><br>I believe in market economies, not just because they\u2019re more efficient and more innovative than other systems, so far devised, but because, when properly structured, they\u2019re compatible with freedom. Scandinavian countries including Denmark demonstrate that.<br><br>But I also believe that the version of capitalism that has come to dominate the global economy has also come to corrode democracy. When you have trillions of dollars move around the globe, in the blink of an eye, outside the control of any sovereign country, far-flung mega companies operating beyond the reach of national regulation or oversight or tax collection, without regard for their impact on local communities or workers, and unconstrained by any values other than their quarterly shareholder report, that\u2019s a lot of power outside of democracy.<br><br>We have to acknowledge, economically, this globalization has made products cheaper, increased interdependence, it has helped drive rapid development in some countries, most notably China. But it has also driven income inequality to levels not seen in generations. In wealthy countries, it\u2019s amplified the loss of bargaining power for workers, it\u2019s stunted wage growth, it\u2019s reduced the status of workers, maybe for all but a narrow band of people in the knowledge professions.<br><br>For some poorer countries, the shift towards automation and relentless foreign competition has actually made it harder to develop viable local industry and expand a fledgling middle class, and there\u2019s been a constant brain drain of educated and skilled workers.<br><br>And while China has emerged as a big winner in the globalization sweepstakes, using export-driven strategies to lift a huge swath of its population out of poverty, it\u2019s come at the price of increased, steady repression and control of its people, and a more aggressive nationalism on the world stage, especially as growth slows and the Chinese government may find it harder to meet peoples\u2019 rising expectations.<br><br>Now, these aren\u2019t conditions where democracy is likely to thrive. When people feel economically insecure, when they feel the game is rigged, anger mounts, resentment builds. When democratic governments can\u2019t respond to these frustrations, partly because they don\u2019t have control, over the tax revenues or the regulatory capacity to deal with the major players in the economy, people grow cynical towards their leaders and the political system that produced them.<br><br>When the gap between rich and poor widens, further and further, then fellow citizens share fewer experiences. The rich people are behind the gate somewhere, and the poor people are outside, and their kids are not going to school together, and they\u2019re not feeling invested in each other. Well, people feel fewer obligations, and social trust declines.<br><br>And in the absence of solidarity, people are more likely to turn to populist appeals from strongmen who offer someone to blame, whether it\u2019s immigrants or minorities or foreign powers or shadowy elites or opposition parties or even democracy itself.<br><br>So if we want to strengthen our democracies, we have to pay attention to economics, and we need to make the global economy more responsive to workers, families, communities, and representative governments. Some of this work on labor protections or corporate governance, on tax policies that reduce inequality, and investment where it\u2019s needed, some of that will happen at a local or national level.<br><br>Other strategies, like ending global tax avoidance and combating kleptocracy, require international cooperation. But our objectives should be clear: reducing the wealth gap, expanding middle classes, restoring peoples\u2019 sense of control over their own livelihoods, making private companies more accountable. We want them to make a profit, but also more accountable for the common good. That\u2019s number one.<br><br>Number two, we need to revitalize our political institutions so that people believe that participation is worth the effort.<br><br>In too many democracies, politics feels like a distant and increasingly irrelevant enterprise. Some of that is by design, by the way. In my own country, for example, we have what\u2019s called a filibuster rule in the United States Senate that has effectively made it almost impossible for either party, even when they have a majority, to get anything substantial through the Senate and passed and signed into law.<br><br>At a certain point, people start wondering, why bother?<br><br>We have governments making it too hard to vote, a lot of governments who make it difficult to see why your vote matters. The powerful seem to have more access. They act with impunity. Over time, the people and their elected representatives break down.<br><br>So every democracy has to take basic steps to restore confidence that democracy is working the way it\u2019s supposed to, like protecting the right to vote, ensuring that vote is counted equally and transparently, holding the powerful to account when they bend the rules or break the law, ending the scourge of dark money that so often corrupts our politics.<br><br>More than that, democracies need to redesign governments so that they can deliver better results. In some cases, that means stripping away bureaucracy and red tape, even when it\u2019s well-intentioned, which makes government unable to move on major initiatives. In the United States right now, building infrastructure, like mass transit or road projects or an airport, it costs like two or three times more than it does here in Europe! And in some cases, it means pushing more decision-making to the local and regional level, so we can road test new ideas to solve problems and build bridges between those in power and the people that they\u2019re supposed to represent, an issue here in Europe that has to be paid attention to. The bottom line is that people care about democratic process, but they also want results.<br><br>Third, we need to spend more time and energy building a democratic culture.<br><br>Those of us who promote democracy, we\u2019re often progressive. We focus a lot on policy. We see politics and governance as pluralistic negotiation between competing rational, self-interested actors. That\u2019s not what moves people in the world. Emotions matter. Stories matter. People care about meaning and purpose and belonging and status. And in this age of uncertainty and polarization, we\u2019ve seen the loss of many of the stabilizing foundations in peoples\u2019 lives, whether its neighborhoods that are disrupted or religious, cultural or civic organizations that are atrophying. Often, it\u2019s authoritarian leaders who understand this, and those of us who believe in democracy struggle to catch up. We avoid what in the United States we call \u201cculture wars\u201d because we want to focus on tax policy. But those emotions are powerful and they\u2019re legitimate. Purpose, meaning, connection. Those things do matter.<br><br>Now, I want to be clear, I have little sympathy for reactionaries who cynically condemn identity politics or cancel culture when really all they\u2019re doing is trying to preserve existing privileges, or excuse entrenched injustice or bigotry. I mean, the original identity politics is racism and sexism and homophobia, and that\u2019s nothing if not identity politics, and it\u2019s done a lot more harm than some tweet from and aggrieved Liberal.<br><br>But what is also true is that, if we\u2019re going to strengthen democracy, if we want to encourage pluralism and civility and self-governance, we have to embrace and restore a language of mutual respect that speaks to peoples\u2019 need for belonging, that they care about the traditions they come from, they care about the places they come from. They want to feel proud about who they are. And that\u2019s easier to do in homogeneous countries; it\u2019s harder to do as countries become more diverse.<br><br>So my point is, a big part of strengthening democracy is not just about politics and policy; it is about culture. And we have to embrace that. We have to expand the civic education that we provide our children and give them practice to live in a democracy. We have to create organizations that give them experience in working with people who are different, and exercise their civic muscles. We need to create platforms that encourage a willingness that nudge people and incentivize people to extend good faith to those who are not like themselves, or don\u2019t think like themselves, a politics that is inclusive rather than exclusive. This is both ethically sound and a practical necessity, something that leaders Gandhi, and King, and Mandela understood. There\u2019s a reason why Nelson Mandela really focused on South African rugby, when he was released. He was sending a signal to those who had imprisoned him for 27 years, that I\u2019m not here to take away your traditions and your identity, as long as you make sure they are compatible with my dignity and respect for my people. (Applause.)<br><br>We need to find ways to build that kind of solidarity and forge connections with people, so that they don\u2019t push us away. That doesn\u2019t mean we have to indulge traditions that don\u2019t live up to our core principles of equality and human dignity, but it does mean that we need to use language that affirms the best of existing national, religious, and culture and ethnic traditions, rather than make arguments that make people feel like they have to abandon all aspects of their past. We can reckon with our darker histories without asking people to reject their own identities. Indeed, progress is about doing the work of perfecting our unions, not repudiating the possibility of a union.<br><br>Finally, as we do all these things, we have to take steps to detoxify our discourse, particularly the scourge of disinformation and conspiracy theories, and hate online that has polluted our political discourse.<br><br>Now, I spoke about at length about this at Stanford University, in the spring, but I\u2019ll just reinforce a few key points. Technology companies have to accept a degree of democratic oversight and accountability. Profit can\u2019t be the only driver for platforms who have acquired power once reserved for nation-states. And while no human endeavor can eliminate human fallibility, we can actually make these things better. These technologies and platforms were made by human beings; human beings can make them work better.<br><br>I look forward to doing more work in the months to come to lift up and put forth new ideas around technology and the other areas that I just mentioned, because these are the areas where we all have to do better. It\u2019s going to determine the fate of our democracies, whether they stick, whether they get stronger, or whether they continue to get weaker.<br><br>But, although I\u2019m ready to volunteer and sign up, and work with existing groups and organizations that are focused in these areas, I want to underscore\u200a\u2014\u200aI\u2019m probably not going to be the main driver of solutions at this stage, nor are many of us in this room, who already\u200a\u2014\u200aI won\u2019t say are passed our primes, but we have gone through\u200a\u2014\u200arun through positions of power. Because we need to build democracy for the future, not the past.<br><br>And what gives me hope is the promise and potential of the next generation of leaders who are coming up, young people who understand that the future of democracy, and in fact, the very planet that we live on, hangs in the balance. These young people are ready to do the work, and many of them are already deeply engaged in the project of rebuilding our democracies.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s who Michelle and I are supporting at our Foundation, and that is why I\u2019m so glad to be joined by just a small sampling of our extraordinary Obama Foundation leaders from all across Europe, who gathered here today. If you can all please welcome, Tudor, Federica and Selvije. Come on\u00a0up.</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/f1747082849d11f26f6f17f0643ac7ee/href\">https://medium.com/media/f1747082849d11f26f6f17f0643ac7ee/href</a><p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> First of all, you can tell what outstanding young leaders they are because they already know you want to bring your own fans to events. (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Before we start our conversation, I would love for each of you very briefly to describe for the audience who you are, what you\u2019ve been doing, and why it\u2019s been so exciting for you to gather with some of the other leaders and peers from across\u00a0Europe.</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI:</strong> First of all, thank you very much, Mr. President, for having us here and thanks to all the Obama leaders out there, because it\u2019s really nice getting an audience with you\u00a0guys.</p>\n<p>My name is Federica Vinci. I am the deputy mayor of Isernia, which is a small town in the south of Italy. The work that I do is basically to try to bring back politics, grassroots politics in a very small town in my region and hopefully, in the future, in my\u00a0country.</p>\n<p>The best part of being here with all these amazing leaders has been having the chance to reconnect with people that do our same job, even if different fields. Sometimes it feels lonely when you are on the ground trying to make change, but reconnecting with all of you has been such a gift, because it reminds us why we\u2019re here and what our purpose is. So thank you very\u00a0much.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> Excellent. (Applause.)</p>\n<p>Tudor?</p>\n<p><strong>TUDOR IULIAN BRADATAN:</strong> Thank you very much. I\u2019m Tudor. I\u2019m from Romania. I am the executive director of what we call an online digital campaigning organization. We work on multi-issues, ranging from the environment to the rule of law. We have an online community with 1.2 million members. This is the people that receive constantly our updates and are invited to take action whenever is needed. We put pressure on decision-makers each time there is a good opportunity.</p>\n<p>We fundraise from our members and this is how we manage to actually win campaigns. Sometimes we fundraise for expensive lawsuits. Sometimes we fundraise for ads in newspapers to get our message\u00a0across.</p>\n<p>I chose this work because it\u2019s my way of defending democracy and it\u2019s my way to help people, simple people from all walks of life to have a say in today\u2019s democracy basically.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> Excellent. (Applause.)</p>\n<p>Selvije?</p>\n<p><strong>SELVIJE MUSTAFI:</strong> Thank you so much. My name is Selvije Mustafi. I\u2019m coming from North Macedonia and I\u2019m national grassroots organizer within the biggest Roma national movement in Macedonia named Avaja, which means we are\u00a0coming.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been active for ten years now from the age of 16 and our movement\u2019s purpose is to build power in the communities and articulate Roma\u2019s issues on higher national\u00a0level.</p>\n<p>And another thing is now that from our movement, we also built another seven national movements in seven different countries, and I serve as trainer trying to build the communities, build the structures, and build\u00a0power.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> Fantastic. (Applause.)</p>\n<p>All right. So we only have about 40 minutes. I want to start with an open-ended question because in my opening remarks, I said that, certainly for my grandparents, my parents, and to some degree for me, when I think about democracy and the tension between democracy and authoritarianism, my reference point is the Cold War. I think about, you know, I was in law school when the Berlin Wall came down. I\u2019m trying to do the math as to whether you were born when the Berlin Wall came down. (Laughter.) I don\u2019t think so,\u00a0right?</p>\n<p>I\u2019m interested, when we\u2019re here at this democratic summit, how do you and your peers think about this issue of democracy in your own countries here in Europe, worldwide? Do you have a sense of concern and worry that democracy is declining? Do you feel cynical about how existing democracies operate?</p>\n<p>Obviously, it\u2019s hard to generalize for everybody your age, but you\u2019re also having a lot of conversations with people who are active and care about\u00a0issues.</p>\n<p>Federica, you want to\u00a0start?</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI:</strong> Being the deputy mayor of a small town, it means that I get to have a lot of meetings with people of my age, but also younger, 15 years old, 16, 18 years old, boys and girls. I remember right after that I was elected and nominated deputy mayor, I\u2019m also in charge of youth policies. Coming from a community organizing background, I decided to call all the representatives of the different high schools of my hometown. We sat around the table and I asked them, so guys, tell me, how have you worked with politicians in the past? What have you guys done together or what has been done for\u00a0you?</p>\n<p>And well, before asking this question, the first thing that they said to me was, have we done anything\u00a0wrong?</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> Why are you calling me in here? Am I in\u00a0trouble?</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI:</strong> Why are you calling us here? Are we in trouble? This made me realize that these guys and these girls had never been listened to\u00a0before.</p>\n<p>When we were talking about politics, they were completely disillusioned, not because\u200a\u2014\u200aand I thought because they didn\u2019t have any luck for the future or they didn\u2019t have any thought about their jobs. But actually they were not even thinking about their future. They had never been listened to. They had never been involved in policymaking. Politicians were doing policies without involving them at all. So they were like, we don\u2019t see politicians. We don\u2019t hear from them. We just see them when they want our\u00a0votes.</p>\n<p>And I think that if we want\u200a\u2014\u200aof course we want democracy, right? We want our rights to be protected. We want our freedom. I don\u2019t think that anybody would exchange democracy for anything in the world. Yet we have to admit that democracy, at least in places like mine, is failing generations, like my generation or generations even\u00a0younger.</p>\n<p>So we as politicians, as leaders have a huge responsibility to go back into these places and make these boys, these girls part of the solution, part of this policymaking process, listen to them and engage\u00a0them.</p>\n<p>Because we are talking about huge numbers. Like Italy has around 8,000 municipalities. 180 municipalities are above 50,000 people. All the rest, more than 7,800 municipalities are really small towns where politicians can have a day-to-day engagement with their constituencies and with those kids. I think it\u2019s our job to do it because this is the only way we can infuse hope in them and in the future of democracy.</p>\n<p>(Applause.)</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> As I listen, I\u2019m going to think of new questions, and I\u2019ll give you a new question, Tudor, but you can answer the old question. Take it where you want. But as I was listening to Federica speaking, she mentioned online. One thing we know about young people, whether in Europe, the United States, Africa, anywhere in the world, a larger portion of their time, attention is on the phone or a\u00a0screen.</p>\n<p>I know that you have worked in thinking about how to use these new technologies to engage people rather than isolate them. What strategies have worked for you when it comes to engaging people online? But how does that also then translate into action in the real world? Because we have an expression in the United States, \u201chashtag activism,\u201d where somebody just tweets like or has a sarcastic comment about something and then kind of feels like, well, there was my political activism for the day. (Laughter.) But it never actually translates into voting, mobilization, initiatives that bring about change. What\u2019s your\u00a0sense?</p>\n<p><strong>TUDOR IULIAN BRADATAN:</strong> I would rather answer with an example. In our world, we always say that e-mail is dead. It\u2019s difficult to reach people via e-mail. And it\u2019s a very good solution because unlike social media, the e-mail is targeted. You have an e-mail address, you send an e-mail, the person receives the e-mail. With social media, it\u2019s much more complicated than that. And with these new networks that arise, it\u2019s hard for us to even find ways in which we can actually tap in with our messaging.</p>\n<p>The example I\u2019m going to give you is with a petition that was started on our website by the students in Romania. They asked for a modernization of the way in which they\u2019re evaluated. They go through the same evaluation that I went through when I went to high school or my sister that is ten years older than me, and it wasn\u2019t\u00a0changed.</p>\n<p>What they did is they signed a petition on our website, 400,000 of them, almost every kid in school in Romania signed a petition. We require an e-mail when people signed that petition. They created that e-mail in order to sign the petition, and we want to work with them together for the next\u00a0steps.</p>\n<p>What happened with that petition? The first time that it was submitted to the Minister of Education, he kind of mocked them. But then they came up with follow-up tactics. The last declaration of the minister is somewhat, \u201cI\u2019m going to think about it,\u201d but already I see them win that campaign. Even if it\u2019s going to take a little bit more time, the way in which they work together, the way in which they are creative to put pressure on decision-makers makes me have much more hope than I have in my generation, for instance.</p>\n<p>I would not treat these kinds of things as individual, things that are too individualistic. We have to work together. The students in Romania, they somehow managed to find ways in which they talked. They used the platform that last time I heard of it, it was for online gaming, people synchronizing on strategies, and they used that software. It was impressive for me to see how well that can be organized and how efficient they are. That is the one thing that brings me a lot of\u00a0hope.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> Selvije, Federica works very local. And you, on the other hand, are part of a European-wide network advocating on behalf of the Roma people. What do you see, what are the trends that you\u2019re seeing in terms of young people getting involved Europe-wide and how do they feel about European democracy?</p>\n<p>Because one of the interesting things about democracy in Europe, I remember when I was president coming here, you had local governments, you had regional governments, you had national governments. Then you had Brussels. You\u2019ve got the EU. You\u2019ve got the European Parliament. There are a bunch of different ways to access politics. But I\u2019m wondering, does that make it more difficult or more accessible for people to want to get involved and to feel like they have a hand in who\u2019s making decisions that affect their\u00a0lives?</p>\n<p><strong>SELVIJE MUSTAFI:</strong> I\u2019m going to start with the following, that democracy has always meant the same. It has meant the voice of the people, the power of the people, the decision of the\u00a0people.</p>\n<p>And what I see in my generation and their perception and feeling of democracy has two aspects. The first one is that the Roma community, in their mid-twenties or even younger, they are very disappointed in democracy in general, also in the approach of how some political leaders are responding to democracy and democratic ideals.</p>\n<p>This has different reasons, because for so long, the Roma in general were excluded economically, politically, culturally, and were underrepresented. They didn\u2019t have their own representative who is coming directly from the community, who knows the issues in the community and the challenges, and who can deliver and articulate and try to solve them. Because representatives who are non-Roma, they cannot know what is happening in the Roma community better than the\u00a0Roma.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, working for ten years now in the community, building power in the community and showing different approaches, like relationship building and so on, the community and the young people see a different added value. They can participate in public dialogs with politicians, with different political actors, with mayors and so on, and they see that this is an element that gives them, how to say, that gives them a value where they can contribute.</p>\n<p>What is the narrative now in the community and among the youngsters? What I hear is, well, maybe we are, because we are the biggest ethnic minority in Europe with over 12 million Roma, maybe we are a key contributor to preserve democracy. And with all the painful, painful history and survivals that we had in the past, now we are still here and we are courageous and brave to take action. And that\u2019s what democracy is about, about bravery, an effort that will bring bigger\u00a0changes.</p>\n<p>(Cheers, applause.)</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> Excellent.</p>\n<p>All those people clapping up there, many of them are working on different issues. The three of you are working on different issues. One of the challenges for democracy in the United States is sometimes people become very narrow in the issues that they\u2019re concerned about. Climate change, that\u2019s a very complicated issue. Criminal justice reform is very detailed.</p>\n<p>Organizations, activists, even elected officials sometimes work narrowly, but in order to build power and actually move the levers of democracy, it\u2019s a huge advantage if you can form coalitions across\u00a0groups.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m wondering, how have you been thinking about in your own work or in conversations that you\u2019ve been having, the need to work across sectors or how do you think about the relationship between working in non-profits versus running for office? Always a difficult debate, I think, does change come more from the inside or from the outside, beating down the door? How have you been thinking about\u00a0that?</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI:</strong> We were just laughing because we were having this discussion 15 minutes\u00a0ago.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> Were you encouraging Tudor to run for something?</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI:</strong> Exactly, run for office,\u00a0yes.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> He\u2019s a very handsome guy. I think he could do\u00a0well.</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI:</strong> I\u2019m trying. I\u2019m trying really hard. But it\u2019s like he wants to be convinced.</p>\n<p>What I believe is that we need way more cross-sectional politics in general, but way more engagement in different sectors. Yes, there are tons of challenges. First of all, generally, as we were saying, activists do not want to run for office. This is what I\u2019m trying to change from the very bottom, because I believe that we have generally attached a very negative meaning to politics.</p>\n<p>While politics is the air we breathe, politics is in every single thing we do. It\u2019s in the transportations that we take, it\u2019s in the climate, it\u2019s in the way we engage with people, it\u2019s in the way we speak, how we are educated; politics is everything. So whenever someone tells me, \u201cOh, politics is bad, politics is corrupted, politics is full of scandals,\u201d I reply, \u201cThis is what governs your life.\u201d If this is what governs your life, do you really want to be governed by the worst people that you think are getting there? And we are electing them in democracies.</p>\n<p>So what I don\u2019t understand and what we were discussing about is that we talk a lot about democracy, but then especially in countries like mine, in places like mine, we have the lowest standards for the people that then get up in the parliament and write these laws for\u00a0us.</p>\n<p>I think that if we really want to change things, we need more people that have super-high moral standards and that want to change things from the grassroots to the top level to get engaged into politics and get elected. Because it\u2019s true that you can get an amazing amount of change as an activist.</p>\n<p>I was an activist before becoming a politician. I was a community organizer.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> Me, too. (Laughter, applause.)</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI:</strong> And I think I still want to be an activist. I want to be an activist. I want to get out and rally for climate change or I want to get out with my people and clean parks, if we need\u00a0to.</p>\n<p>But we cannot avoid thinking that politics is not part of the game. Politics is part of the game. Politics will always be part of the game. And if we don\u2019t think that we don\u2019t have to get engaged, then we will keep being governed by the people that we don\u2019t like, even though we vote for them. And then we have voter apathy and we have kids not going to vote and we have people getting way, way far away from politics, while this still governs our\u00a0life.</p>\n<p>This has to change and I am arguing that this needs to change from the very bottom where people like me, politicians, can start talking face to face with their constituency and regaining the trust that they\u2019ve lost so far because they have been governed by the wrong people, because the right one were just too scared of the bad environment that politics brings up\u00a0on.</p>\n<p>(Cheers, applause.)</p>\n<p><strong>TUDOR IULIAN BRADATAN:</strong> Almost convinced me, but no. I have resistance still.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> I\u2019m not going to put you on the spot today and ask you to announce your candidacy, but this goes to the issues of this summit. It\u2019s often easy to defend democracy in the abstract. But if you have been an activist and you\u2019ve been working from the outside, sometimes it is difficult to see why change is moving so slowly on the inside. As I said in my remarks, some of that is by\u00a0design.</p>\n<p>As somebody who started locally and then ended up running a pretty big government, a lot of the activists who worked with me would get frustrated and think somehow that, well, how come he hasn\u2019t gotten this done or that done yet? It must be because he no longer cares about us. He\u2019s talking to all these rich contributors and this and that. When, in fact, no, I still want exactly what you wanted, but the wheels of government are just moving very slowly because there are all these systems that are set up to block\u00a0it.</p>\n<p>The reason I say that is because I think for democracy to work, you have to have both. You have to have people who are in the engine room and the deck of the ship of democracy, working to make it move in the right direction, but you also have to have people on the outside who are constantly maintaining pressure and getting people involved, because that\u2019s the engine, that\u2019s the fuel that ultimately is going to get you to where you want to\u00a0go.</p>\n<p>And so, I\u2019m interested in how\u200a\u2014\u200aas I said, Tudor, you don\u2019t have to announce your candidacy.</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI:</strong> Not\u00a0yet.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> Because there is an important role to play in citizen participation, activism, organization. And so far, that\u2019s the role you\u2019ve chosen to play. Do you feel like you can make enough of a difference taking that approach, particularly if maybe sometimes you see\u200a\u2014\u200ayou said like the education minister seemed like he\u2019s not listening to 400,000 students. Do you think, \u201cyou know what, we should have somebody in there who does\u00a0listen?\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>TUDOR IULIAN BRADATAN:</strong> It\u2019s a big temptation for many activists to go into politics, and I admire those who do. It\u2019s not a matter of me thinking that politics is dirty and we should not touch it. No, politics is where decisions are\u00a0made.</p>\n<p>My fear is that, if people like me enter politics, we leave an empty spot in the civil society, and that supporting a country like Romania was difficult to fill in the first place. We are a young democracy. If all of us from the civil society turn into politics, we need to bring new people to form this new civil society. What I noticed in my line of work is that politicians become better when we demand them to do\u00a0so.</p>\n<p>Now, I think that in a way, the civil society is like that bad medicine that tastes bad, but you still need to take it because it makes you healthy. I like to be that medicine that tastes bad. It makes me feel better. (Laughter, applause.) But if I would get one single dollar each time I\u2019m invited to join politics, I would solve the funding for my organization for ten years. (Laughter.)</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA:</strong> Let me start with you on this question, Selvije. We talked about online organizing, but one of the things that I do think has changed, even since I was in office, was the amount of misinformation, the difficulty of sorting between what\u2019s true and what\u2019s false, what\u2019s journalism and what\u2019s fabrication.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m wondering how all of you in the work that you try to do have dealt with the misinformation problem, whether it affects your work and whether you\u2019ve come up with some solutions, so that you can get facts and information out to people and you don\u2019t have to spend all your time refuting things that people think that aren\u2019t true, and in some cases politicize issues that shouldn\u2019t be political.</p>\n<p>In the United States, as I think many of you saw, COVID became somehow a political issue and getting vaccinated or wearing masks. A lot of that was driven just by misinformation that was out there, and that seems to be happening on more and more issues. I\u2019m wondering how it\u2019s affected you and whether you\u2019ve seen some solutions to help young people distinguish between what\u2019s true and false in making decisions about how to participate and what to\u00a0support.</p>\n<p><strong>SELVIJE MUSTAFI:</strong> Yes, definitely digital, the digital space has fundamentally altered on how people are being exposed to engage with information. And I think that the internet has enabled a lot of people to create and expand different kinds of content by a large audience at marginal costs, and it\u2019s instantly and freely accessible.</p>\n<p>However, there are big concerns also in our movement about how false information and misinformation is spreading on the internet to influence decisions by some political actors or political sides. So using the social media, you can create, and you can expand different kinds of misinformation.</p>\n<p>And as you said, the challenge is that those kind of fake news and misinformation are making the people to have a different kind of opinion, which is not necessarily relevant or truthful. And this is an issue we have also with the Roma community, a community who has been discriminated for so long, ignored. It\u2019s very easy. There is a big base to spread fake news and to make them think like that, and not necessarily they can now differentiate what is opinion and what is\u00a0fact.</p>\n<p>So what we do as activists, as movements, and\u200a\u2014\u200aI mean, what we what we can\u2019t do is we cannot\u200a\u2014\u200awe don\u2019t have the space and tools how to regulate the internet, but what we can do is to try to counteract this kind of false news and to try to actively produce content that is relevant and spread the frequency of our own message and our own narrative.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA: </strong>Excellent. Frederica, as an elected officials and activist, is that a problem that you\u2019ve seen in terms of the work that you\u2019re doing? Do you find you make a proposal, and somebody says, \u201cWell, you know, I just saw on the internet that what you\u2019re doing is going to cause cancer,\u201d or it\u2019s going to, you know, destroy the economy or something? And then you have to spend a lot of time unwinding some of\u00a0this?</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI: </strong>Yeah, and exactly, words like this. I really\u200a\u2014\u200alike a simple example, the cost of energy and the cost of water, they rose because of the war, yet we had a couple of newspapers saying that, since\u200a\u2014\u200athat we were getting paid by the taxpayer money of this increase in water and\u00a0energy.</p>\n<p>So it obviously is false, and it obviously should be easier to think about it, because it\u2019s like the war, and it\u2019s something way above us. Yet, what comes out there, and even what I notice is that it\u2019s even easier for people to get out this false news and this false noise, and it\u2019s\u00a0scary.</p>\n<p>So, and it\u2019s not just about that. It\u2019s about rumors that get out. It\u2019s about voices, rumors, like people talking to people. So in a very small town, you have a huge amount of rumors coming out, and our question was like, how do we counteract against it? What do we\u00a0do?</p>\n<p>So of course you can work online, but in such a small town, and again, Italy is full, and I guess also Europe, it\u2019s full of such small places. You can have a real confrontation with your constituencies.</p>\n<p>So we\u2019ve started having town halls in like open-air tunnels, and now that it\u2019s summer and COVID is not such a big risk, especially outside. And we\u2019ve asked people to join us in sharing with us their fears, their questions, what they want, how can we answer to their problems?</p>\n<p>And the first time, nobody asked questions. It was really weird, but then\u00a0\u2013</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA: </strong>Everybody just sat there for half-an-hour?</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI: </strong>Yeah, exactly, so we started talking about our policies, but then\u200a\u2014\u200ayeah, but then, on our policies, they started asking questions. And many of the were really good questions. We see a lot of anger on Facebook, a lot of anger on social media. And when you go in real life, first of all, this anger is not that bad, but second, it has a motive. It has a\u00a0reason.</p>\n<p>And when you meet your people and you can ask them, you can listen to them, you actually know what those reasons are, and you can give them answers. And not only, I think we should give them answers, but I think we should include them in the decision-making process and the implementation of the policies that we bring\u00a0about.</p>\n<p>So to counteract this fake news environment in the small town, I guess that the real solution is coming back on the ground, the grassroots, meeting with people, answering their questions, involving them and making them part of the changes that we want to see\u00a0around.</p>\n<p>(Applause.)</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA: </strong>Excellent. So we\u2019re coming to the end of our session here, and I want to give you a two-part question. If you ever decide to run for office, this is how reporters get around it. They\u2019re only supposed to get one question, that is, \u201cSir, I have a five-part question,\u201d and then they go and tick them off, and so I\u2019m going to use the trick they taught me. And you can answer both, either one, or just don\u2019t answer, which is also a strategy that I taught them. (Laughter.) And talk about what I want to talk\u00a0about.</p>\n<p>I opened with my remarks, and obviously an enormous amount of time has been spent at this summit, talking about the tragedy of what\u2019s happening in Ukraine. And I\u2019m wondering how you think this has affected you, your generation, to witness this kind of crisis in the heart of Europe in a way that harkens back to your grandparents\u2019 generation. It\u2019s been a long time since we saw that much violence, and now we can witness in real time and displacement. So I\u2019m curious how has it impacted you and your friends? How do you talk about it? And does it encourage you to see the response and make you more committed to the public work that you\u2019re doing? So that\u2019s one question.</p>\n<p>Part two, because we\u2019re running out of time, is what are the things that do inspire you and keep you going? Because I think, whether it\u2019s you Frederica or Tudor, but I know you all feel it, sometimes the work gets lonely. And sometimes democracy is discouraging. What is it that has kept that optimism and hope going even when you confront setbacks and when you feel like democracy\u2019s not working? So why don\u2019t we start then with\u00a0you.</p>\n<p><strong>SELVIJE MUSTAFI: </strong>Well, I think that the recent context and situation has affected generally the youth and in particular in the Roma community in many aspects, in many ways, psychologically, financially. And there is a lot of frustration.</p>\n<p>And as a matter of fact, in Ukraine, there are a lot of Roma. There is a big Roma community who has also been put aside and discriminated for so long. But yet again, the Roma who are there are fighting for Ukraine, and they are fighting for\u00a0freedom.</p>\n<p>So I hope the war ends as soon as possible. And I hope that after the war, Roma won\u2019t be forgotten.</p>\n<p>What really inspires me, because for so long the narrative towards us was negative. Many, much of stigma, negative perception, and big part of the Roma community accepted that. But going into the community, talking to people, working with people, and seeing how much of a big potential the Roma are, and how much of a big capacity we have, this is what really inspires me and drives\u00a0me.</p>\n<p>And this is something that I felt from the very beginning of my activism, 10 years ago, and I still feel it whenever I go to the community. And I think that this is the new generation of a driving change. And a community who can preserve democracy and who can be part of preserving democracy in the next period, and I hope, I really hope that Europe, European stakeholders and institutions will have more openness towards Roma and more inclusiveness in particular.</p>\n<p>(Applause.)</p>\n<p><strong>TUDOR IULIAN BRADATAN: </strong>When you asked me about\u200a\u2014\u200alike, how do I see democracy now, it made me realize that I\u2019m\u200a\u2014\u200ain my family, I\u2019m the first generation that lived their young years in peace and democracy. My parents, they lived theirs in the Cold War. My grandparents fought in World War II. My great-grandparents fought in World War\u00a0I.</p>\n<p>And so I am the first one, basically, that lived to see democracy. Now, I\u2019m not that young. I have gray hair. I still can hide it underneath the other parts. And I still remember the days in Romania when we were a dictatorship. I was very young, but there are things that still are very strong memories, the queues to go and buy food, the heaters that were cold in the\u00a0winter.</p>\n<p>I do not want to go back that. And for many years I thought that, for instance, war is something that is unthinkable, and after 2014, it became obvious that war is again a thing in Europe. And it scares me. And that\u2019s the reality. But that\u2019s what\u200a\u2014\u200aI mean, when we get paralyzed with fear, that\u2019s when they win. Fear is not really an option for us, because I do not want to go back to the days when Romania was a dictatorship. I do not want to see those atrocities happen\u00a0again.</p>\n<p>So I will fight with everything I have to keep the democracy going and make sure that this system, as imperfect as it is, keeps on going because it is the only thing that allows me to be in places like this to meet the amazing leaders that I met in the last few days. And meeting you is something that would have been unthinkable for my parents\u2019 generation.</p>\n<p>So we have to defend this because what would come next is unimaginable.</p>\n<p>(Applause.)</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA: </strong>Madam Mayor, you get the last word\u00a0here.</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI: </strong>When it comes to Ukraine, I still remember the day of the war, and I remember calling my friends in\u200a\u2014\u200aI mean, we were all shocked, and it was something that lasted for a while. Like we had that punch in the stomach. We couldn\u2019t think about what was happening. We couldn\u2019t think about the fact that we were\u200a\u2014\u200alike that our borders, like Ukraine, which we consider Europe, were at\u00a0war.</p>\n<p>And we are like a really big European generation, and so we felt extremely attacked, sad, lost, somehow. But on the other hand, it was also sort of a wake-up call, a reminder that, in Italy, at least in my town, and in my region, we are still lucky enough to be able to keep working on our democracy, that it\u2019s not working as we would like it to be. It\u2019s not being like we would like it to\u00a0be.</p>\n<p>So that, that brings me to the point of what is it that is passionate for me, and moves me, especially when you live in a town where, in front of you, you don\u2019t have just your political opponent, but probably the woman who stole your boyfriend when you were 15 years old and you still haven\u2019t forgotten.</p>\n<p>(Laughter.)</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA: </strong>That\u2019s a good point. I mean, that\u2019s\u200a\u2014\u200aif it\u2019s, you know, that makes it a little more personal.</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI:\u00a0</strong>Exactly.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA: </strong>You\u2019re, no\u200a\u2014\u200aI wasn\u2019t pointing. She\u2019s not here. I was pretending that I was pointing (laughter).</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI: </strong>But it gets harder because you want to do stuff, and you know that you can\u2019t move on because probably there is something personal behind it. So how do you do it? And this is also what gave me\u00a0hope.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll tell you, like a short story. I have been working with this woman\u200a\u2014\u200anot working, but I would have loved to have worked with this woman, but since I\u2019ve gotten elected, she\u2019s been opposing every single thing that I try to propose, from the football court for the kids, from a youth center, and with no reason, I couldn\u2019t understand why.</p>\n<p>So one day I went into the local high school to talk to the youth of the local high school, and I was talking to them about the fact that my mom wanted me to become a lawyer. My dad wanted me to become a consultant. I tried both, I hated them both. And then I got into politics, which was my\u00a0dream.</p>\n<p>And I told these kids that we live in a society that doesn\u2019t give us the space to understand who we are, what we love, and what we want to do. So it\u2019s their job and our job as politicians to support them in finding the space and allowing them to become what they\u00a0want.</p>\n<p>Great speech. I went back home, slept on it. The morning after, I receive a call. It was this woman, and she said, \u201cLook, my daughter was on the stage and was listening to you, and she filmed you, and she sent me the recording. And I wanted to thank you because my story is your story with the difference that I didn\u2019t have the courage that you had to follow my own dreams. And having you out there talking to my daughter about the fact that you did gave my daughter the confidence to come to me and say that she wanted to become an architect. So thank you very much. I\u2019m looking forward to work with you on this youth\u00a0center.\u201d</p>\n<p>(Applause.)</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA: </strong>That\u2019s\u00a0great.</p>\n<p><strong>FEDERICA VINCI: </strong>Knowing that, beyond being politicians, we are human beings that share stories, and at the end of the day, we all want this world to be a better place, that\u2019s what gives me hope, because I see, every single day, that we can overcome our differences. We can build bridges. We can close the gap between the politicians, the high school girls that had a fight over a boyfriend. And we can unite on what really matters for us. And this gives me a lot of\u00a0hope.</p>\n<p><strong>PRES. BARACK OBAMA: </strong>Good. Well, you\u200a\u2014\u200athe three of you give me hope. The young people who are working with us at the Foundation are giving us hope. For those of you who are already parts of organizations working on democratic issues, either here or on other continents, I cannot tell you enough that we have to invest in this cohort if we are going to succeed. Because every time I have a chance to have conversations, the kind of idealism and innovation and imagination and courage that you\u2019ve heard from these three, they\u2019re out there. And they need to be heard, and they need to be empowered, because they\u2019re going to be the ones who take us where we need to\u00a0go.</p>\n<p>All right. Please give them a big round of applause. Thank you, everybody. Thank\u00a0you.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=e9740dc78c5a\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n","enclosure":{},"categories":[]},{"title":"Announcing the Voyager Scholarship for Students with a Passion for Public Service","pubDate":"2022-05-16 13:18:03","link":"https://barackobama.medium.com/announcing-the-voyager-scholarship-for-students-with-a-passion-for-public-service-d2ce85607087?source=rss-9e422a605dc5------2","guid":"https://medium.com/p/d2ce85607087","author":"Barack Obama","thumbnail":"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*yI-8k7ZbfiaNaQuImhK4RA.jpeg","description":"\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*yI-8k7ZbfiaNaQuImhK4RA.jpeg\"></figure><p>In an increasingly globalized world, forging connections is more important than ever.

That\u2019s why the Voyager Scholarship helps students with financial aid, meaningful travel experiences to expand their horizons, and a network of leaders who can support\u00a0them.</p>\n<p>I hope you\u2019ll take a moment to <a href=\"https://voyager-scholarship.obama.org/\"><strong>discover what the Voyager Scholarship is all about</strong></a>. Applications are open now until June 14 to rising juniors in the United States\u200a\u2014\u200aso please help us spread the word to eligible undergraduate students.</p>\n<p>As we\u2019re seeing around the world, we can\u2019t take democracy, or tolerance, or progress for granted. We have to work for it. And that means supporting the individuals who want to be forces for\u00a0good.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=d2ce85607087\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n","enclosure":{},"categories":[]},{"title":"My Statement with Michelle on the Draft Supreme Court Decision to Overturn Roe v.

But what <em>Roe</em> recognized is that the freedom enshrined in the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution requires all of us to enjoy a sphere of our lives that isn\u2019t subject to meddling from the state\u200a\u2014\u200aa sphere that includes personal decisions involving who we sleep with, who we marry, whether or not to use contraception, and whether or not to bear children.</p>\n<p>As the court has previously determined, our freedoms are not unlimited\u200a\u2014\u200asociety has a compelling interest in other circumstances, for example, in protecting children from abuse or people from self-harm\u200a\u2014\u200aand the framework constructed by <em>Roe</em> and subsequent Court decisions allowed legislatures to impose greater restrictions on abortion later in pregnancy. But this draft decision doesn\u2019t seek to balance these interests. Instead, it simply forces folks to give up any constitutionally recognized interest in what happens to their body once they get pregnant. Under the Court\u2019s logic, state legislatures could dictate that women carry every pregnancy to term, no matter how early it is and no matter what circumstances led to it\u200a\u2014\u200aeven rape or\u00a0incest.</p>\n<p>The consequences of this decision would be a blow not just to women, but to all of us who believe that in a free society, there are limits to how much the government can encroach on our personal lives. And this decision is unlikely to significantly reduce abortions, which have been steadily going down over the past several decades thanks in large part to better access to contraception and education. Instead, as we\u2019ve already begun to see in states with restrictive abortion laws, those women with means would travel to states where abortion remains legal and safe. Meanwhile, those without enough money or access to transportation or ability to take off from school or work would face the same circumstances most women faced before <em>Ro</em>e, desperately seeking out illegal abortions that inevitably pose grave risks to their health, their future ability to bear children, and sometimes their\u00a0lives.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s a result none of us should want. But it should serve as a powerful reminder of the central role the courts play in protecting our rights\u200a\u2014\u200aand of the fact that elections have consequences.</p>\n<p>A clear majority of Americans support <em>Roe</em>. Yet we recognize that while many are angry and frustrated by this report, some of those who support <em>Roe</em> may feel helpless and instinctively turn back to their work, or families, or daily tasks\u200a\u2014\u200atelling themselves that because this outcome may have been predictable, there\u2019s nothing any of us can\u00a0do.</p>\n<p>If that\u2019s you, we ask you to think about the college student waking up after her date forced her into unprotected sex. Think about the couple that tried to have children for years, who are without any options when faced with the tragic reality of an unviable pregnancy. Think of any of the hundreds of thousands of women each year who deserve the dignity and freedom of making a decision that is right for their bodies and their circumstances.</p>\n<p>You might be one of those people.
